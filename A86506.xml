            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Edications</hi> of Books are to me a ſcruple. The truth of God is leſſe mine, then a day, or a place, to dedicate to creatures, and more able to defend it ſelfe then any thing on earth. And Delarations in Epiſtles are in my opinion ſo curious a thing rightly to manage, as that there is more hazard of their miſcarrying, then hope of doing good. Yet ſeeing importunity will not be ſatisfied without an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, therefore thus:</p>
            <p>Hearing of Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his book <hi>againſt Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> comming forth with ſuch a mighty ſhout of acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though of ſome fitter to admire then to judge; this made me in haſte to ſee it, if it might prove convincing upon my ſpirit. But finding upon a conſcientions weighing, that it was not of ſtrength to bereave the <hi>faithfull</hi> ſonnes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> of their right, and hope to give the little ones of their tender bowels to the pledge of God, the firſt ſeal, annexed to the promiſe, <hi>I am the God of thee &amp; thy ſeed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2. Gen. 17.</note> 
               <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you and your children;</hi> But like a violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be forced at firſt, and languid towards the end, I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered it. And having upon occaſion of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among my brethren, then in order to be diſcuſſed, found that I could fairly anſwer Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his arguments with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant ſatisfaction to my ſelfe and ſome others; but all that doubted could not at firſt hearing, feel the weight of every
<pb facs="tcp:159553:3"/>paſſage; I was partly occaſioned hereby to give them my thoughts in print. And the rather that I might heare the judgements of the Saints, whether I had thought aright of the queſtion? And if not, by friendly conference to cleare up to me the mind of God in it. Mean while I could not but lament the untimely birth of Mr <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>Exercitation,</hi> and his unneceſſary falling in travell with it, after at leaſt ſix able brethren, and about ſo many dayes, by nervous diſput ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had given him ſo much cauſe to doubt of his Tenet, or at leaſt, a while to ſuſpend it.</p>
            <p>For the queſtion about Infants-baptiſme is yet rather a controverſie of <hi>privat</hi> perſons, then of <hi>Churches;</hi> theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt prudentially carefull now rather about the right form of a particular Church; to which the adminiſtration of the firſt ſeale doth nothing contribute, at leaſt in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of its generation.<note place="margin">Matth. 3. Acts 8. Acts 10. Acts 16.</note> For many were baptized in the New Teſtament, whoſe baptiſme neither <hi>found them in,</hi> nor <hi>formed them into</hi> any particular New-teſtament Church. The Scripture is either contrary to, or utterly ſilent concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it.<note place="margin">Joſh. 5.4, &amp;c.</note> Even as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> while they were fourty years in the wilderneſſe, without the adminiſtration of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi> (all the circumciſed ſaving a very few being dead) are called a <hi>Church,</hi> Acts <hi>7.38.</hi> So that the ſuppoſed want of the due adminiſtration of the firſt <hi>Signe,</hi> doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church a Church, or prejudice the proper forme thereof. But the inſatisfactory calling of the Anabaptiſts-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their pretended better baptiſme, upon a former worſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited-baptiſme; being either not extraordinarily called; or not having the firſt Seale themſelves; or being <hi>Sebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> that is, ſelf-baptizers; or baptiſed with the old ſort of Infant-baptiſme: (in either of which they are moſt unlike to <hi>John THE BAPTIST</hi>) hath juſtly cauſed many to hold off from them, and many to fall away from them. And many that are with them, to be at a loſſe where to reſt. One Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb facs="tcp:159553:3"/>at firſt adding to their Infani-baptiſme, the adult baptiſme of ſprinkling: then not reſting therein, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to adde to that, a dipping, even to the breaking to peeces of their Congregation. Since that, the Miniſter firſt dipped himſelfe. Not contented therewith, was after baptized by one, that had onely his Infant-baptiſme. Thus doth Gods juſtice leave us to find nothing in an or dinance, when we put too much upon an ordinance; and from too much, to fall to nothing, but a crying out, <hi>All Ordinances, Miniſteries,</hi> &amp;c. are all polluted. So that as before they could not tel where to <hi>end,</hi> ſo now not where to <hi>begin</hi> to reform, and ſo out of that pretence turn <hi>As they were,</hi> in order, <hi>Nothing.</hi> Contrary to that unanſwerable place, <hi>Epheſ. 4.</hi> 
               <q>That Chriſt aſcending, left a Miniſtery, or Miniſteries;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> all or ſome; by ſucceſsion, or new election, or extraordinary miſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſtill a conſtant ſupply of a Miniſtery;</q> 
               <hi>for the work of the Miniſtery, the perfecting of the Saints, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was thus forward, to put forth before others of my abler brethren, not out of ſelf-confidence (the Lord knowes,) but, beſide mine owne private intereſt in my doubting friends, partly from advantage of time in knowing ſome of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his arguments, and partly from the aſſault of them that gave me the firſt <hi>Alarme,</hi> I ſent forth this ſcattered forlorn hope, ſcarce well rallied and arraied to my mind, through haſte, to ſet the moveable popularity at a ſtand (if it might be;) keep the paſſe, and maintain the fight, till better help ſhould come in. This (though leſſe then I hoped, by reaſon of preſſures of mine own buſineſſe, and ſlowneſſe of Preſſes) I have attained. And ſo I expect thoſe worihy brethren, that have perhaps more time, and more parts, and reading, I am
<pb facs="tcp:159553:4"/>confident, then my ſelfe, to carry on the main Battalio, and to maintain their ground with thoſe Brigades, wherein they are by name engaged. For it would have been diſorder, if not preſumption, and prejudice to the cauſe for me to have anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated them.</p>
            <p>In that I have done, as I was hopeleſſe to pleaſe all, ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling juſtly to diſpleaſe any, ſaving in the very opinio in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And therefore let no ingenuous reader take offence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the word <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> (uſed onely as the known term of diſtinction;) or at the <hi>much quotation of Fathers, and Antiquities</hi> in an hiſtoricall way, being neceſſarily drawn thereunto by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or at <hi>any quickneſſe of expreſſion,</hi> it being, if I know my ſelfe, rather the complexion of my ſtile, then any intention of ſharpneſſe. The Lord, I truſt, hath now made me better to know and to make known a Goſpel ſpirit, eſpecially in print and preaching.</p>
            <p>If any notwithſtanding that have read Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not patiently read over thoſe on the other part, they cannot be excuſed of partiall injuſtice, and of unfaithfulneſſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to the truth, in that they will not heare with both eares. <hi>Qui parte alterâ inauditâ aliquid ſtatuerit licet aequum ſtatuerit, haud aequus eſt.</hi> It's the law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he that without hearing either party paſſeth ſentence, though he determine a juſt thing, yet he is not a juſt Judge. The Lord ſettle thee and me in the truth of the Lord Jeſus, is the earneſt prayer of thy faithfull friend in the Lord,</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. relates to <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.11. of Gods oath to <hi>Abraham;</hi> not of the form, or ſigne, or adminiſtration of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19.21. <hi>My covenant will I ſtabliſh with Iſaac,</hi> that is, with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for an everlalting covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Where it is ſaid, that with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that is, Chriſt, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhall be eſtabliſhed; the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of the <hi>efficacie</hi> of the covenant, ſhewing wherein and whereby the covenant ſhall be effectuall; namely, by faith in Chriſt. But where it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.9. <hi>I am the God of thee and thy ſeed, thou ſhalt keep my covenant therefore, to circumciſe all the males of thy houſe,</hi> it is ſpoken of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adminiſtration of the ſigne of the covenant. So that in the ſame chap. where the holy Ghoſt intimates the <hi>efficacie</hi> of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be onely with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in Chriſt; yet doth he command the outward adminiſtration of the ſigne to all the males in <hi>Abrahams</hi> honſe, yea to <hi>Iſinael,</hi> though to him the covenant ſhould not be eſtabliſhed, as it is expreſſed, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19, 23, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>☞ The want of the obſerving this diſtinction between the <hi>efficacie</hi> of the covenant, and the <hi>form and outward adminiſtration</hi> of the ſigne of the covenant is that which hath bred much of the diſpute between the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and us.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159553:6"/>for the Scripture is very clear in it to me touching every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.

But of the efficacie it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The word profits not without faith.</hi> The <hi>form</hi> of <hi>baptiſme</hi> is, <hi>Baptize in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Matth. 28.19. But of the <hi>efficacie</hi> we have other expreſſions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. <hi>viz. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt, baptized into his death, buried with him, planted into his death.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>baptized with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> So the <hi>form</hi> of adminiſtration of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is, <hi>Take, eat, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which was given and broken for you, do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Mat. 26.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14.

And ye <hi>ſhew the Lords death till ye come. ibid.</hi> And ye are <hi>all one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.17.</p>
               <p>Sutably we have it in Scripture, that many partake of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> that partake not of the <hi>efficacie.

               <list>
                  <item>1 The children are reckned with the parents in all ordinances communicable to both, by warrant of Scripture. As till the Jews were broken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. Till the vineyard was let out, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. Circumciſion went along with the parents to children; when pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents loſt it, the children loſt it. When <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was caſt out of the Church, his poſteritie was not circumciſed, that we read of. By the ſame proportion <hi>baptiſme</hi> goes along from parents to children.</item>
                  <item>2 There is a double preaching, and a double Sacrament. A preaching to the heart, and to the eare: An innitiating and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating Sacrament. God can preach to the heart when not to the eare. He a Spirit can preach to a ſpirit without ſentences, and ſo to children. This preaching is moſt ſutable to infants, becauſe thus man is altogether <hi>paſſive:</hi> ſo the innitiating Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is fit for infants, becauſe in that they can be but paſſive.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The ſoul of an infant is out of the body all one with an Angel. And therfore one defines a ſoul, <hi>An Angel in a body.</hi> If the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act, yet God can act without the body. As we ſee great revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, viſions, &amp;c. were given when the body was aſleep and unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. See the Patriarches, &amp;c. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw a moſt glorious viſion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:159553:8"/>when he had no uſe of his body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. To make the inward worke of grace to depend on the body, is like the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> yea worſe to make a worke depend not only on rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but on ſence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infer, that the ſame reaſon on which the adminiſtration of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was grounded, the adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:159553:9"/>grounded. So that the Apoſtle doth not only ſhew how <hi>Baptiſme</hi> comes in the roome of <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> but that it comes in the roome and is adminiſtred upon the ſame ground; <hi>Ergo</hi> to the ſame matter or ſubject. For children now as well as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. are alike capable of that ground. So the children here are made free of Gods Citie, the univerſall Church, by the Fathers Coppy, whether the Father be <hi>preſent,</hi> as the <hi>Jew,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle ſpake, or <hi>farre off,</hi> either <hi>Jewe,</hi> whether unregenerate, and farre off in <hi>time,</hi> or ſcattered, and ſo farre off in <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>Gertile,</hi> that is farre off in <hi>both,</hi> if any of theſe are called, the Promiſe is to them, and their children. If any <hi>Gentile</hi> believe, he is a child of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. and ſo the promiſe, and firſt <hi>Seale</hi> are to him, and his children; as the Promiſe and <hi>Circumciſion</hi> were to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his children. And therefore when <hi>Zacheus</hi> is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, preſently it is ſaid, <hi>Salvation is come to his houſe, for as much as be alſo is the ſonne of Abraham,</hi> Luk. 19.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But is not the Promiſe here meant of the extraordinary gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>as to ſpeake with tongues, doe Miracles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. How then doth this ſuit with the <hi>Promiſe to Abraham,</hi> to which this Text relates, as we proved afore?</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Apoſtle applies the Promiſe here meant to his hearers now preſent, for their ſalvation whiles they cryed out in their unregenerate eſtate, <hi>what ſhall we doe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 All did not receive theſe <hi>extraordinary gifts.</hi> But all that are baptized into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt receive the <hi>ſaving gifts</hi> of the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. Therefore this Promiſe is to be extended beyond the gifts of Miracles, or other extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, &amp;c. For as all agree that, theſe were but the <hi>Firſt-fruites</hi> of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Spirit, in that <hi>viſible manner;</hi> to ſignifie the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant effuſion of the <hi>ſaving</hi> gifts of the Spirit, in an <hi>inviſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> in future ages. So that this muſt be a a Promiſe <hi>to all</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſo to their children or ſeed indefinitely, <hi>that they ſhall receive the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But are not theſe words <hi>[as many as the Lord ſhall call]</hi> an explication of <hi>Children;</hi> ſo that the Promiſe is <hi>to their children</hi> with this condition, <hi>if they ſhall be called?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No. For firſt, If ſo; then the Apoſtle needed not to ſay to you <hi>and your children;</hi> but only to have ſaid <hi>the Promiſe is to you, and to all the Lord ſhall call.</hi> But this Promiſe is applyed to them <hi>the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:159553:9"/>Parents</hi> afore their <hi>calling,</hi> that <hi>it is to them</hi> as they are children ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to birth, of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Believer, to the end to <hi>call them;</hi> and ſo to be continued to them <hi>when called,</hi> and their children; and then it followes; <hi>And to all that are a farre off, when they ſhall be called,</hi> and ſo to their children (ſo it muſt be ſupplyed) ſo that <hi>Calling</hi> is an explication of the ſentence <hi>to them that are a farre off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Jewes</hi> to the end to <hi>better,</hi> rather then to <hi>worſe</hi> their condition. But their <hi>children</hi> by vertue of the outward priviledge and Tenor of the Covenant, to and with them the parents, had the ſigne of <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> therefore (by the Apoſtles intent) their children ſhould alſo have <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> If this had not been the Apoſtle meaning, he had left theſe <hi>Jewes children,</hi> and all their <hi>Infant-poſterity</hi> in no better condition, then the moſt barbarous Heathens then in the world; and this had ſpoyled theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> comfort, and croſſed the Apoſtles deſigne, to draw them to Converſion, and the new Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> for confirmation of that Converſion.</p>
               <p>Now we go on with the place in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Namely,</p>
               <p n="3">3 Obſerve that this <hi>Covenant</hi> is called <hi>everlaſting,</hi> which cannot be truly, and properly ſo ſaid of this, and other Ceremonies, but as relating to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Therefore, if the Covenant be <hi>everlaſting to them and their ſeed,</hi> indefinitely (as <hi>Election</hi> is propounded in the Scripture to us) then the ſealing of it <hi>outwardly</hi> to both them and their ſeed, muſt be everlaſting to the worlds end; and to all eternity inwardly to whom it is effectuall. And therefore as in the Old-Teſtament it was ſealed by <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> ſo in the New-Teſtament by <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we come to <hi>animadvert</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his formes of Argument from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. as reported by him.</p>

                  <q>1 Chriſt is called the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by way of excellencie. Gal. 3.16.2 All the clect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7. All beleevers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18. that is, the ſpirituall ſeed. 3 There was a naturall ſeed to whom the inheritance did accrue, <hi>viz.

But no where do I find that the infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers of the Gentiles are called <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. Of the three former kinds of <hi>Abrahams ſeed</hi> the promiſe recited, is meant; but in a different manner thus. That God promiſeth he will be a God to Chriſt, imparting in him bleſſing to all Nations of the earth; to the <hi>ſpirituall ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> in evangelicall benefits; to the <hi>naturall ſeed</hi> inheriting in domeſtick and politick benefits.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Sure the holy Lord in a Covenant would not be thought to equivocate, and be uncertain in his meaning.<note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> Though God appoints the outward <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of the covenant to <hi>Abraham</hi> the beleever his ſeed indefinitely, Gen. 17. yet he gives the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie</hi> of the covenant but to ſome; <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhall be the <hi>ſeed</hi> by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Yet we muſt follow the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> according to expreſſe inſtitution, Gen. 17. To whom is derived the covenant effectually, to them are derived the promiſes of bleſſing in every manner recited by the Exercitator (ſubordinate things are not contrary) or in no manner <hi>per modum aut vim faederis,</hi> under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>covenant.</hi> Unregenerate men have a right to temporall things, by an <hi>humane right,</hi> and higher, by a <hi>divine right of common providence,</hi> either as dwelling with, or receiving them from thoſe in reall covenant with God; but not by vertue of any covenant between them and God.</p>

               <p>If a Gentile beleever be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.11.

To the inſtance of <hi>Cameron</hi> we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; that when I ſeriouſly read the whole <hi>Theſis,</hi> I can make no more then this; that by <hi>primarily</hi> he means <hi>immediately,</hi> and 1. in order; and by ſecondarily <hi>mediately,</hi> and 2 in order, and cannot be underſtood as <hi>chiefly,</hi> and not <hi>chiefly.</hi> For ſure the more ultimate and ſpirituall an end is, and ſo more like and neer to God, the more chief it muſt be. So that according to <hi>Camerons</hi> inſtances (for he gives three) circumciſion did more chiefly intend <hi>ſanctification,</hi> circumciſion of the heart, as the Scripture oft advanceth it, and ſo ſpirituall <hi>ſeparation of the mind from earthly things,</hi> them the <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their nation from other kingdoms,</hi> by a mark in their fleſh. So ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>paſſeouer</hi> ſigned rather, <hi>Chriſt our paſſeover</hi> for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. then the <hi>Angels paſſing over the Iſraelites, and not ſlaying them in Egypt.</hi> So the <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> did more intend our <hi>ſpirituall purification by Chriſt,</hi> then any carnall purification, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron</hi> cals it. We adde that Baptiſme as well as circumciſion doth not only ſignifie regeneration, but puts a diſtinction between them, and Heathens at leaſt; as all not circumciſed in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were counted Heathens.</p>
               <p>To the 2 partic. of the illuſtration we thus anſwer. That it is not in the formall analogie of circumciſion between the ſigne and the thing ſignified, nor ſet down in any expreſſe form eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially annexed, to ſet forth the nature of circumciſion, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion as circumciſion, doth ſignifie, ſigne or ſeal Chriſt <hi>to come,</hi> as <hi>to come.</hi> For as Chriſt come himſelf, was circumciſed, ſo many were circumciſed after <hi>jure divino,</hi> the ordinance being in full force till Chriſt was ſacrificed; if <hi>Paul</hi> did not by that rule, after Chriſt had been long aſcended, circumciſe <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> So that for three yeers and an half, circumciſion from <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, to Chriſts death ran parallel and even together authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in the Church of the Jews in the New Teſtament in ſeveral, if not the ſame ſubjects; in ſome, if not in all that received the 1. ſeal. It is true, circumciſion and other ceremonies by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the circumſtance of time of adminiſtration in the Old Teſtament did <hi>imply</hi> Chriſt to come, but could not of themſelves
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:159553:14"/>either <hi>ſignifie,</hi> or <hi>conſignifie</hi> Chriſt to come, for the reaſons above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. Even as Baptiſme either by analogie in the ſigne, or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any form annexed, as ſetting forth the eſſence of baptiſme, doth not ſignifie <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>come.</hi> For ſome were baptized (as the Scripture cals it) before Chriſt came. As thoſe in the Ark, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. the Iſraelites, men, women and children in the <hi>Red ſea,</hi> and the <hi>cloud.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, &amp;c. And this the Jews underſtood as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; and therefore do not ſay to <hi>John</hi> wherefore baptizeſt thou? but by what authority. <hi>Jeh.</hi> 1.23. And the Rabbins make mention, that the Jews foreſaw alſo the baptizing with fire, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>To the third partic. our anſwer is this: That circumciſion as circumciſion belonged to all of all Nations (and their children) that ſhould come in as <hi>proſelites</hi> to the Jewiſh Church, whether conſtituted in a family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13. or in the Nation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 47, 41, 49. as Baptiſme in the New Teſtament to all, and onely thoſe that came into the Chriſtian Church; and their children. I ſay into the <hi>Chriſtian Church;</hi> that is, the parents came in at leaſt into the <hi>univerſall viſible Chriſtian Church;</hi> by confeſſing Chriſt to be the Son of God; and ſo this difference pretended by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>baptiſme</hi> and <hi>circumciſion</hi> comes if not to a ſameneſſe yet to a likeneſſe; and ſo the reaſon thus far apparently to me, is the ſame between both. And the like argument may be drawn for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the one, as of the other.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt exception Mr. <hi>T.</hi> makes againſt this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. is,<note place="margin">Exercit. Sect. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> that theſe termes <hi>federate,</hi> and <hi>to be ſigned</hi> are not convertible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are convertible <hi>jure</hi> in <hi>equitie;</hi> For Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not doubt but that thoſe <hi>ſigned</hi> with circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. or, &amp;c.

And all <hi>federate,</hi> or counted within the covenant were to be <hi>ſigned</hi> with circumciſion. So this text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 8, 9. <hi>I am a God to thee and to thy ſeed, thou ſhalt keep my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant THEREFORE, that every man-childe be circumciſed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>But to this fourth exception,<note place="margin">Exercit. Sect. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>4. 1</hi> Partic.</note> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> argues. That ſome there were circumciſed, to whom no promiſe in the covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did belong. Of <hi>Iſmael</hi> God had ſaid, <hi>that his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:159553:14"/>was not to be eſtabliſhed with him.</hi> Gen. 17.20, 21, 25. Rom. 9.7, 8, 9. Gal. 4.29, 30. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Eſau.</hi> All that were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, whether ſtrangers, or born in the houſe were circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13. of whom nevertheleſſe, it may be doubted, whether any promiſes of the covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did belong to them. There were other perſons,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2</hi> Partic.</note> to whom all, or moſt of the promiſes in the covenant pertained, that were not circumciſed. This may be affirmed of the <hi>females</hi> coming from <hi>Abraham;</hi> the <hi>infants dying before the eighth day;</hi> of juſt men living out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, as <hi>Melchiſedech, Lot, Job.</hi> If any ſay that the <hi>females</hi> were circumciſed in the circumciſion of the males, he ſaith it without proof.</q> And by like,<note place="margin">Mr. T. his an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer to an Ob.</note> perhaps greater reaſon may it be ſaid, that the children of beleevers are <hi>baptized</hi> in the perſons of their parents, and therefore are not to be baptized in their own perſons. But its manifeſt, that the <hi>Jews</hi> comprehended in the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, were nevertheleſſe not admitted to Baptiſme, by <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts</hi> diſciples, till they profeſſed repentance,<note place="margin">1 Concluſ</note> and faith in Chriſt. Hence I gather, that the right to Evangelicall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, "was not the adequate reaſon of <hi>circumciſing</hi> theſe, or thoſe, "but Gods precept, as it is expreſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.4.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> to 1 <hi>Particular.</hi> [That ſome there were circumciſed to whom no promiſe in the covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did belong.] Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> argues from the <hi>non-fact</hi> to the <hi>non-equitie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Animad.</note> and from the <hi>non-efficacie</hi> to <hi>non-adminiſtration,</hi> and from an <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcovery</hi> to croſſe the <hi>preſent rule;</hi> which arguing he knows, carries not with it in other things any conſequence. What if <hi>de facto</hi> ſome were not circumciſed according to the directory of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; therefore <hi>jure</hi> ought they not, if opportunities and accommodations concurred? What if ſome appeared after when men not to have the <hi>efficacie of circumciſion;</hi> were they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly circumciſed, when the inſtitution did injoyn, and cauſe it to be done, whiles they were infants? I need not inlarge upon the inconvenient ſequels in the uſe of all ordinances, if that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations may not be, though ineffectualneſſe appear not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes after.</p>
               <p>And howſoever it be apparent in ſome, and doubtful in others,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:159553:15"/>(and therefore infer nothing) that the promiſe was not <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> that is, was not <hi>effectuall</hi> to them, yet it is moſt apparent that the <hi>inſtitution</hi> and <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of circumciſion is grounded on the expreſſe <hi>promiſe.</hi> As <hi>I am the God of thee, and of thy SEED, therefore thou ſhalt keep my covenant to circumciſe every male.</hi> Gen. 17.7.9. The promulgation and preaching of the promiſe belongs to many, to whom it is not after effectuall. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. and if the inſtitution muſt go along with the promiſe here in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. though it might be ſpecially revealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> what a one <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhould prove; then ſure much more amongſt men who have no ſuch revelations. And though we grant the 1. line in this 1. partic. of Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> "that <hi>no promiſe in the covenant belonged to Iſhmael;</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> confeſſeth that circumciſion ſigned <hi>civill</hi>

And that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17 20. made to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> of <hi>bleſſing and multiplying him, muſt at leaſt be ſuch;</hi> though eminently, and as concerning the coming of Chriſt, it is emphatically ſaid that in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall the covenant be <hi>eſtabliſhed.</hi> Gen. 17. However, <hi>Abraham</hi> looked ſo much on the promiſe, <hi>I am the God of thee and of thy ſeed,</hi> and the commentary upon it touching bleſſing <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and the inſtitution grounded on that promiſe (however the effect ſhould prove) that he circumciſeth <hi>Iſhmael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For others within the covenant, yet <hi>de facto</hi> not circumciſed; we muſt needs ſee that it is by reaſon of other cauſes, and not the want of connexion between thoſe two <hi>foederati &amp; ſignandi,</hi> that is, <hi>to belong to the covenant,</hi> and to <hi>be ſigned with the covenant.</hi> If God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt infants by death that died within the ſeven dayes, being not fit in nature for ſo ſharp a Sacrament, what can we infer more againſt the inſtitution of this Sacrament, then againſt any other. As for <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> which was <hi>Sem</hi> (as the moſt learned agree upon unanſwerable reaſons) he was born 500 yeers before the inſtitution of <hi>circumciſion,</hi> whoſe inſtitution is not to look higher then to <hi>Abraham</hi> at the higheſt, and ſo to deſcend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. If we could be ſure that <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were not circumciſed; we could as ſurely anſwer that <hi>Job</hi> was not in the <hi>Land, Lot</hi> not in the <hi>County</hi> where the inſtitution of circumciſion was then made known. And for <hi>women,</hi> the inſtitution of circumciſion rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not to them, becauſe there was no fit matter for that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That <hi>alteration of nature</hi> to intimate they were a peculiar ſeed ſet apart from the Heathens as well as the males were, was
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:159553:15"/>done in their fathers; on whom was acted more then the water can act, namely, to make a <hi>naturall change,</hi> though no ſpirituall followed. So that theſe particular inſtances did deſtroy the ground and nature of the inſtitution of circumciſion being onely accidentally and extraordinarily excepted, upon the aforeſaid reaſons; no more then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fourty yeers journey in the wilderneſſe hindering circumciſion ſo long did detract from the ordinary inſtitution and ground thereof. And therefore we</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To both the concluſions, that the claim to this promiſe (which Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> confeſſeth<note n="*" place="margin">Exercitat. Sect. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>2. 3.</hi>
                  </note> to be Evangelical in the ſubſtance) <hi>I am the God of thee and of thy SEED</hi> was the adequate reaſon in the ordinary proſecution of circumciſing. For though the inſtitution then is to <hi>Abrahams family,</hi> and to the <hi>males,</hi> &amp;c. yet the ground is the promiſe; <hi>I am thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> And ſo <hi>federate,</hi> and <hi>to be ſigned</hi> are convertible in regard of the ground; upon which it followed that <hi>Abraham</hi> was to have a Gentile ſeed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. to which the ſame promiſe ſhould run, <hi>I am your God, therefore the God of your ſeed.</hi> However if <hi>federate</hi> and <hi>to be ſigned</hi> were not convertible terms, but onely this true, that all <hi>federate are to be ſigned:</hi> as thus ſuch as to whom the promiſe is given, <hi>I am your God,</hi> and ſo of <hi>your ſeed,</hi> being circumciſed, their children by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or adoption (as it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13.) ought to be circumciſed; thus much would ſerve our turns out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. for the <hi>baptiſme</hi> of beleevers children. Though we could not turn the propoſition convertibly, <hi>that all circumciſed or baptized are truly and effectually fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, in covenant.</hi> But how it may be turned we have ſhewed afore.</p>
               <p>And thus I leave the ingenuous Reader to judge how <hi>great,</hi> or how <hi>little</hi> reaſon Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath to deny the <hi>major,</hi> or <hi>minor</hi> propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 1 Argument out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We anſwer. That we muſt beware of circumciſing and cutting off the tenor of the covenant, taking onely thus much (as many do) <hi>I am thy God;</hi> or drawing it out beyond its length (as others do) thus; <hi>I am the God of thee, and thy ſeeds feed;</hi> but take it evenly

               <p>But whether this be all that may be concluded out of the place alledged, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> affirms) I ſhall appeal to the ingenuous Reader of our obſervations on this place of Scripture; which are from the analyſis, ſcope, argument, and method of proſecution: which if not exactly attended, we may eaſily feign plauſible interpretations for our own turns, but looſe the drift and argument of the Apoſtle. The Apoſtles <hi>deſigne</hi> is to take off the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> from falſe doctrines of falſe teachers, teaching with entiſing words, <hi>Philoſophy, vain deceit, traditions of men, rudiments of the world,</hi> among which were the ſhels of Jewiſh ceremonies, as circumciſion conſidered in the ſhell of the outward ſigne, &amp;c. And the argument the Apoſtle uſeth as the beſt means to fetch them off, was to advance <hi>Chriſts fulneſſe,</hi> to the full worth, before the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:159553:19"/>eyes of their minds. This deſigne, and this manner of purſuance of it are ſo oft mentioned and repeated combinedly; that they cannot be hid from an ordinary eye looking upon the text. Once <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. again <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. a third time <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. Now the Apoſtle ſaying ye are compleat in Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 10. (Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> filled up, or made compleat) he intimates, what need the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> hearken after Jewiſh ceremonies, as circumciſion, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Coloſſians might object, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarkes had Chriſt, and yet were circumciſed too, he anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates and prevents this objection, <hi>v.</hi> 11. ſaying, they had inward circumciſion, which is the chief. <hi>In whom alſo ye</hi> (obſerve the <hi>alſo ye</hi>) <hi>are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of ſins, &amp;c.</hi> Your perſons are not onely circumciſed in the circumciſion of Chriſt (who is as our common nature) and ſo <hi>imputed</hi> to you (as in <hi>Adam,</hi> the common nature of man, we finned, and ſo his ſin was imputed to us) but you are circumciſed with the <hi>vertue of Chriſts grace,</hi> ſignified <hi>in circumciſion,</hi> to make you put off the body of ſins (even as <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was not onely impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, but his corruption of ſin derived into us). But becauſe the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might object again, that though <hi>Abraham</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumciſion before (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) yet he had outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion too, and ſo others; and therefore they were not ſo compleat in Chriſt as beleevers in the old Teſtament. The Apoſtle preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupates and prevents this objection too, in <hi>v.</hi> 12, ſaying, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of outward circumciſion, they had been baptized, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized effectually into Chriſt. <hi>Buried with him in baptiſme, wherein alſo ye are riſen, through the faith of the operation of the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, in ſtead of the outward ſigne of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, Chriſt hath inſtituted another ſigne, namely, baptiſme; that circumciſion being to be done away (at Chriſts death at leaſt) and this to be uſed inſtead thereof; more ſignificant then the other; for circumciſion fitly ſignified ſpirituall death to ſin, which is mortification, but baptiſme is fitted to ſignifie more; namely, your riſing from under the water lively repreſents your ſpirituall life by Chriſt, your riſing to newneſſe of life; and both theſe have been effectually ſigned or ſealed to you by baptiſme; And therefore you are no longer to call for circumciſion, but to uſe and injoy baptiſme in the ſtead thereof, as formerly you and your children did circumciſion (for the Apoſtle hints not the leaſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:159553:19"/>difference about the ſubject thereof.) Even as Chriſt himſelf <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed</hi> the eighth day, was after <hi>baptiſed</hi> to ſignifie an end now about to be put to circumciſion. This I ingenuouſly think to be the naked ſcope, and plain argumentation and method of the Apoſtle here in this 2 of <hi>Coloſ.</hi> Which ſecondly, more appears to us by theſe two arguments. 1 From the inconveniences againſt the Apoſtles diſpute, if baptiſme doth not ſo come in the roome of circumciſion. For firſt if we have not <hi>baptiſme</hi> in the room of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> to us beleevers, and our infants, we are not ſo <hi>compleat</hi> (as the Apoſtle affirms) as the Jews, by Chriſt. Secondly, if bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme doth not come in the roome of circumciſion, how doth the Apoſtle call off the Coloſſians from circumciſion, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their baptiſme? How doth he truly imply that as the firſt Sacrament that beleeving <hi>Abraham</hi> and his children recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was circumciſion, ſo the firſt, the beleeving Coloſſians and their children received was baptiſme, (no other ſeal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening)? How are the Coloſſians ſaid to be inwardly <hi>circumciſed,</hi> and outwardly and inwardly <hi>baptized</hi> in the ſame <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who in himſelf put down the one by taking up the other?</p>
               <p n="2">2 From the analogie and agreement between both, namely, circumciſion and baptiſme; which the Apoſtle hints in this 2. of <hi>Coloſ.</hi> Firſt the Apoſtle intimates that as putting off the body of ſin (which is a phraſe to ſignifie <hi>naturall</hi> death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and ſo is here an alluſion to ſignifie ſpirituall death to ſin) is the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>circumciſion.</hi> Coloſ. 2.11. So ſpirituall burying (which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues death) is the ſignification of <hi>baptiſme.</hi> Secondly, that as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe are aſſured to any but as having Chriſt ſealed to them; ſo as <hi>circumciſion</hi> ſealed an implantation into the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he put off the body naturally in the grave; ſo the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed put off the body of ſin ſpiritually; <hi>v.</hi> 11. Even ſo bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſignifies and ſeals our implantation into the buriall of Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 12. as is more fully expreſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That as the way to kill ſin, and ſo to live was by circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Chriſt in the old Teſtament. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.11. inſomuch that he that ſhould wilfully neglect outward circumciſion for himſelf or his child that might have it, ſhould be cut off, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. So bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing into Chriſt is the way to bury ſin, and ſo to live. <hi>v.</hi> 12. of this 2 <hi>Coloſ.</hi> inſomuch that he that ſhall wilfully neglect baptiſme with water, the ſeal of regeneration who may have it: ſhall not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:159553:20"/>enter heaven. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. A ſoul may be ſaved without the uſe of a ſeal in ſome caſe, but in no caſe can be ſaved in the contempt of a ſeal. I am not ignorant that ſome do underſtand this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. of the ſpirit onely compared to water, but who doth not know that (as <hi>Bullinger</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omnes penè de baptiſmo interpretantur</hi>) all almoſt interpret it of the water of baptiſme, <hi>Bullinger</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting with them, onely he would not have the efficacie of the Spirit, to be transferred to the ſigne. And ſure whiles Chriſt was inſtructing <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of regeneration, he would not be ſilent tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſeal of it, baptiſme. Nor can we ſo well parallel this phraſe with <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Baptiſing with the holy Ghoſt and with fire;</hi> where onely the Spirit muſt be meant, becauſe there is no other baptiſme of fire. But there is a baptiſme, with water, beſide bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme with the Spirit. And therefore water muſt ſignifie baptiſme. For it were harſh to run to a metaphor without need, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by <hi>water</hi> the Spirit, which in relation to the efficacie of baptiſme is uſually called <hi>fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have ſhewed out of this <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. from the ſcope of the Apoſtle; the analogie of the two Sacraments, and the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of the contrary; that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> ſucceeds in the roome, and to be uſed inſtead of <hi>circumciſion;</hi> now let the ingenuous Reader ponder, and ſee whether there be not more in this text, then Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> would acknowledge.</p>
               <p>To that paſſage of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> that <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. <hi>doth not ſpeak of any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but of Chriſts circumciſion,</hi> meaning I ſuppoſe the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt in his own perſon, (for elſe all circumciſion, and baptiſme too is Chriſts, both in regard of inſtitution; ſigne, and making effectuall) we have anſwered already, in the analyſing of the place. The ſumme whereof was, that not onely Chriſts cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was imputed to them, but the vertue of circumciſion was inherent in their hearts, by expreſſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that other paſſage, that the text, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. doth not ſay, <hi>We are circumciſed, becauſe we are baptized;</hi> We anſwer, and adde to our former intimations, that the Apoſtle clearly labours to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> from ſeeking to be circumciſed, becauſe they were inwardly eircumciſed; and inwardly circumciſed, becauſe inwardly baptized, according to the outward ſealing of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:159553:20"/>or elſe he had not mentioned <hi>baptiſme</hi> upon any juſt ground or pertinent cauſe to the point in hand that I can conceive. He tels them they had no need of circumciſion, which was aboliſhed; and had the effect of it ſealed by, and conveighed through or with outward baptiſme which they had received according to the order of calling men to be Saints in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>In ſome things, ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi> baptiſme doth not ſucceed in the place of circumciſion in reſpect of ſignification. For firſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did ſignifie Chriſt to come of <hi>Iſaac</hi> according to the fleſh. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 21. But baptiſme doth not ſignifie this, but points at the incarnation, death, and reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though we have anſwered to this afore,<note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> on Exercitat. <hi>p.</hi> 4. yet we adde, Firſt, as circumciſion did no more ſignifie Chriſt to come of <hi>Iſaac</hi> (for any thing that is in the analogie, or form of inſtitution or adminiſtration) then of <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſo <hi>baptiſme</hi> hath in it as well to ſignifie the true Chriſt to come of <hi>Iſaac</hi> as <hi>circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>ver.</hi> 10. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. hath nothing in it but what is ſpoken in common to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed indefinitely. That <hi>v.</hi> 21. is not the inſtitution or form of adminiſtration, or any thing to expreſſe the analogie of circumciſion to the thing ſignified, but onely a word added touching the making circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion <hi>effectuall,</hi> and imports onely that Chriſt is the <hi>effect</hi> of all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, he is he that muſt eſtabliſh the Covenant, in all its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſeals. <hi>In him are all the promiſes yea and amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. He is the <hi>ſeed</hi> to whom and in whom promiſes were made, and to be made firm. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.16. It was not all <hi>Iſaacs ſeed</hi> that could eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Covenant; but <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nor did <hi>Chriſt</hi> more eſtabliſh as <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſeed, then as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed ſpiritually. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. Thirdly, that whereas afore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 4. of his Exercitat. that <hi>Baptiſme aſſures Chriſt to be already come</hi> (to which we anſwered, that no ſuch thing appeared in the <hi>analogie</hi> of water; nor in the <hi>form</hi> of adminiſtration, to wit, <hi>I baptiſe thee in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> nor in the <hi>uſe;</hi> many being baptized afore Chriſt <hi>came.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, &amp;c. many before Chriſt <hi>came to act</hi> his mediatorſhip, of doctrine, paſſion, reſurrection (his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation onely <hi>preparing</hi> him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. mine <hi>eares haſt thou opened, or bored,</hi> Hebr. 10.5. A body haſt thou <hi>prepared</hi> me.) Now Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſpeaks more warily, <hi>Baptiſme points at the incarnation, death, &amp;c. of Chriſt.</hi> Well, and how doth it point at the <hi>incarnation</hi> and <hi>death</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:159553:21"/>of Chriſt more then circumciſion? Did not <hi>circumciſion</hi> ſignifie <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be born according to the fleſh of one circumciſed? Did not cutting off of the fore-skin and drawing blood as well point at death, as ordinary afflictions are ſaid <hi>to kill all the day long.</hi> Rom. 8? Sure that bloody Sacrament did as much, if not more point at Chriſts paſſion, as <hi>a little being under the water and up again</hi> did in <hi>baptiſme.</hi> But to ſignifie time to come, or time paſt, that was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implyed in the time of adminiſtration; if either Sacrament adminiſtred afore Chriſts coming, then it pointed at Chriſt to come. If after his coming, then Chriſt come.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Exercit. p. 6.</note> (ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi>) <hi>circumciſion</hi> was a ſigne that the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were a people ſeparated from all nations. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. But <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> ſignifieth that all are one in Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And doth not baptiſme as much ſeparate all the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and their children from all the Nations <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized,</hi> as <hi>circumciſion</hi> did <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the proſelytes out of every Nation from the <hi>uncircumciſed?</hi> For that is the difference, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Go teach all nations, baptizing them.</hi> If nations do not receive this teaching and baptizing, there is the difference that men can put. And it is as wide, as uſually circumciſion did put; the Iſraelites generally being evill, and very oft idolatrous. And it is a queſtion to me, wiſhly looking on that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2, whether their keeping the <hi>oracles of God</hi> is not put if not as the <hi>ſpeciall</hi> difference. Compare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. laſt, yet as the <hi>equall</hi> difference with <hi>circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> (the Turks, &amp;c. circumciſe, but have not the oracles of God) and then what more is conferred on circumciſion, then on bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme? The Word muſt go before, and along with a Sacrament, or elſe it will appear rather a mixture of heatheniſh ſuperſtition, then a diſtinction. And for <hi>baptiſme,</hi> it doth indeed ſignifie that all we Gentiles with the Jews that are baptized are all one in Chriſt, as before circumciſion ſignified that all <hi>Jews</hi> with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, that were circumciſed, were one in Chriſt. But me thinks the text <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. ſpeaks of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as making us all one. If of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, then of baptiſme as made an effectuall means to put into Chriſt; and then effectuall preaching is as well a means, and ſo no ſpeciall thing is put to advance <hi>baptiſme</hi> above <hi>doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly (ſaith he) circumciſion ſignified that <hi>Moſes</hi> law was to be obſerved.<note place="margin">Exercit. p. <hi>6.</hi>

               <p>If Baptiſme be not granted to the Infants of Beleevers, then the Grace of God will be more reſtrained in the New Teſtament than in the Old: but this is not to be affirmed; therefore Baptiſme is to be granted to Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this Argument be of any weight, it will prove that the grace of God is ſtraitned, becauſe we give not the Lords Supper
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:159553:23"/>to children, to whom the Paſſeover was given, as appears by that which was ſaid before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The grace of God is not tyed to Sacraments, neither do Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments give grace by the work done, and therefore grace is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, though Sacraments be never granted, grace is not denyed to an excommunicated perſon, who is inhibited the Lords Supper, the grace of God is free, whether we underſtand it of the divine affection, or the effects of it; nor can be made larger or narrower by our act.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet it is not abſurd to ſay, that in reſpect of ſome priviledges, the grace of God is more contracted in the New Teſtament then in the Old: For inſtance, no family hath now the priviledge that was granted to <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, that out of it Chriſt ſhould be born; no man beſides <hi>Abraham</hi> is called <hi>The Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</hi> no woman beſides one, <hi>The mother of Chriſt;</hi> nevertheleſſe, ſimply the grace of God is ſaid to be larger in the New Teſtament, by reaſon of the revelation of the Goſpell imparted to all Nations, the more abundant communication of the holy Spirit, and more plain manifeſtation of the myſtery of the Goſpel: I would have it weighed, whether thoſe phraſes of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21. as <hi>the naturall branches,</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>The wild Olive by Nature,</hi> were <hi>graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed contrary to Nature.

                     <item>1. Here ſeemes to be an eluding of the true intent of our Argument, by the equivocal acception of the word <hi>Grace:</hi> for if any forme it of <hi>Gods Grace</hi> being reſtrained, it is rather meant of <hi>Grace</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the <hi>favour</hi> of God manifeſted to us, then of <hi>Grace</hi> ſignifying the <hi>Graces of Gods Spirit</hi> inherent in us.</item>

Of the Oracle of God, and his promiſe was immediately <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> by expreſſe words made and delivered <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and ſo they had the priviledge alſo to heare ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it; and it continued a long time in their line, in the former ages of the World; and ſo had the 1. conveighance of the 1.

And therefore we conclude that faith being the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Covenant <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. to <hi>Abraham</hi> (as Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> confeſt afore. §. 1.) and ſo thereupon the 1. Seal was given to his naturall borne infants; So now a believing Parent by faith being of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gal. 3. Rom. 4.) the 1.

As Circumciſion ſealed the entrance into the Covenant, the righteouſneſſe of faith, and circumciſion of the heart; ſo doth Baptiſme much more clearly. As Abraham and his houſhold, and the Infants of believing Jews were to be circumciſed; ſo the faithfull, their families, and their ſeed are to be baptized.

The former part of the verſe runnes ſo, <hi>the promiſe is to you and your children:</hi> therefore the latter part muſt run ſo too, to wit to all that are afar off that ſhall be called and to their children: For it were a ſtrange thing if whiles the Lord is preſſing the ſame promiſe, as belonging to them that are <hi>neer</hi> and <hi>a far off, Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which God firſt made to beleeving <hi>Abraham</hi> and his naturall ſeed under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and preſſing it ſo to be taken and applyed here, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. that the Lord ſhould mean two different wayes, as that it ſhould belong formerly to beleeving <hi>Abraham</hi> and his naturall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under the promiſe; but now to him, and onely his children ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called: Or that it now belongs to <hi>Abrahams</hi> beleeving <hi>Iewiſh</hi> ſeed, and their naturall ſeed or children under the promiſe, and not to beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> (the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.

                     <item>2. If the ſentence <hi>as many as the Lord our God shall call,</hi> be a limitation of the whole verſe, and ſo to ſignifie that the promiſe no wayes belongs to <hi>children of beleeving Iewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till thoſe children be <hi>effectually called,</hi> let any rational man give a ſufficient reaſon why the Apoſtle mentions <hi>children:</hi> the ſentence being full and clearer without that word, if that had been the Apoſtles meaning.</item>
                     <item>3. The Apoſtle names the promiſe to the parents in relation to them before calling; as being the children of beleeving <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off: why then may it not ſome how much more relate to their children, when they the next parents are called?</item>
                     <item>4.

               <p>To the 4, particular we ſay that the reaſon of that is becauſe it is ſpoken to them of ripe yeares, pricked at their hearts.

The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from 1 Cor. 7.14.</note> may be thus formed They who are holy with Covenant holineſſe, may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; but ſo are beleevers infants holy: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> is not true, univerſally underſtood, as is manifeſted from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>If the firſt fruits be holy, the lump is holy,</hi> &amp;c. That is, <hi>Abraham</hi> is the firſt fruite and holy root: the elect <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are the branches and lump: ſo that it followes, that the elect of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> not yet called, are holy in reſpect of the Covenant, and are not yet therefore to be baptized. For although they may be ſaid to be holy in regard of the Covenant of old entred into with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the gracious reſpect of God to them to be manifeſted in time,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:159553:28"/>yet in their preſent ſtate; they denying Chriſt, neither infants nor men are to be baptized, unleſſe we would have the branches broken off to be grafted in. And therfore though the ſence of 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 7.14. were <hi>your children are holy with Covenant holineſſe;</hi> it followes not they are to be baptized who yet manifeſt no <hi>ſhewes of</hi> divine grace. 2. The <hi>Minor</hi> is not proved hence. For it doth not ſpeak of <hi>federall holineſſe,</hi> but of <hi>holineſſe,</hi> that I may ſo call it, <hi>matrimoniall.</hi> So that the ſence is <hi>your children are holy,</hi> that is <hi>legitimate.</hi> So Maſter <hi>Tombes.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

It was <hi>de jure</hi> in right and equity an univerſall Propoſition, <hi>That every man-child of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed parent ſhall be circumciſed,</hi> Gen. 17.

So this Propoſition they that are holy with federall or Govenant holineſſe, may be <hi>baptized,</hi> is by <hi>divine right</hi> univerſally true: but if in <hi>practiſe</hi> the generations of <hi>Abraham,</hi> alive at the comming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will not own the <hi>SEED</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Chriſt,</hi> and ſo renounce their own Seed-ſhip; God gives them up in <hi>fact</hi> to be broken off for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain generations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.

                     <item>1.

Nor doth the ſame <hi>Camerarius</hi> hide, or refute another meaning of theſe Words; <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>ſanctifying by faith;</hi> that is to the <hi>believers uſe,</hi> as Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> his <hi>Melancthon</hi> intimates in his own quotations. For <hi>Melancthon and Muſculus</hi> they come not to hand in my ſtudy, nor is it of ſo much, or have I ſo much time as to go to them. For our <hi>own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,</hi> if Mr <hi>T.</hi> had but well weighed one onely, <hi>Pareus,</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he ſhould have ſo miſtaken this Text. The meaning of which to me and others, plainly and candidly is this. You <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> (in your Letter to me, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) ſcruple about ſpirituall pollution, by a believers continuing in the uſe of marriage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal injoyment, ſince converſion, with a yoake-fellow that is not yet converted through his or her infidelity, v. 13. But you need not feare it; for the unbelieving husband hath been <hi>already</hi> ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (ſo in the Greek) in the believing wife that is ſince converted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:159553:29"/>ſince marriage, I ſay <hi>in</hi> the <hi>beleeving</hi> wife (ſo is the meaning plain by the Antitheſis, and ſo it is in ſome Greek Copies). And on the contrary the <hi>unbelieving wife</hi> is ſanctified <hi>in</hi> the <hi>believing huſband:</hi> ſo the Greek, and the Antitheſis and the Explanation of ſome Greek Copies. That is, the unbeliever is ſanctified in the believer <hi>to the believers uſe.</hi> That though <hi>marriage,</hi> as <hi>all things</hi> are ſpiritually impure and unclean to them that are defiled (how?) by <hi>unbeliefe; yet unto the pure</hi> (that is by faith, as the Antitheſis guides it) <hi>all things are pure,</hi> marriage, meats, all. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Being ſanctified by the Word</hi> (allowing them and promiſing a bleſſing to the believer) and <hi>by prayer</hi> (of faith) asking a bleſſing. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5. And this I prove (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) by a greater argument: Becauſe your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (though but one of you Parents be a believer) <hi>are holy;</hi> I ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>are holy;</hi> not onely as before of the unbelieving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that he or ſhee is ſanctified and <hi>ad hoc</hi> to a particular uſe of the other beleeving parent; but <hi>are holy,</hi> which cannot poſſibly ſignifie leſſe then the Federall or Covenant holineſſe; reckoned general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> to be within the Covenant with the believing parent (though but one of them be a beleever). But how doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prove this laſt propoſition upon which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends? <hi>Anſw.</hi> He layes this, leaves this, on a common knowne practiſe of the Churches everywhere, that if but one of the parents were a beleever, the children of him or her were brought to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as to the ſealing, that the children were in Covenant; of which more in the XIII CHAP. of our <hi>Animadverſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mean while obſerve that if the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak here of the holineſſe of children, by being reckoned in Covenant, and ſigned with Baptiſme, being born of one believing parent at leaſt, as of a known opinion, cuſtome and practiſe in the Churches, the Apoſtle had gone about to reſolve a leſſer doubt, by making a greater. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences againſt this ſence of the place ſhalbe ventilated and confuted by and by, after we have confirmed this to be the ſence of this place; thus.</p>
               <p>This caſe of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> muſt needes be a caſe not of <hi>law,</hi> but of <hi>conſcience;</hi> not of civil polity, but of religion, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſuch caſe as <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3. where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> having taken wives not of the ſame religion with them, make a Covenant with Humiliations, to put away thoſe wives and their children. For the religious <hi>Corinthians</hi> men of great parts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:159553:29"/>City and of a moſt ancient Common-wealth, could not be ignorant of the <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> That two ſingle perſons Legally married, according to the cuſtome or rules of the State, could not be counted adulterers or fornicators, or their children baſtards, for any difference of Religion between them. And therefore it being a caſe of Conſcience, about ſpirituall pollution, ſatisfies them by ſhewing the priviledge of faith under the New Teſtament, that all wives, infants, &amp;c. are <hi>ſanctified,</hi> or ſanctified <hi>to the beleever,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding different opinions: To which <hi>Beza</hi> ſpeakes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, <hi>Some</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>refer this to civill politie, what marriages that makes and accompts as ratified; ſo as the children are reckoned Legitimate: But ſurely Paul diſputes not of civill politie, but of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſcience. And what Argument (I pray you) at laſt would it be to pacifie conſcience, that is taken from the civill Lawes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For in theſe Laws it is well known, how many things are tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, which a Chriſtians conſcience cannot bear. For neither the Law of divorce, permitted to the Jews by Moſes for the hardneſſe of their hearts, could excuſe a conſcience from the fault of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for M. <hi>T.</hi> and his abettors (by him quoted) in reaſoning for <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial holineſſe;</hi> and againſt <hi>federall holineſſe</hi> they do not (to me) in any conſiderable degree hit the nayl on the head; and therfore is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pluckt out with ones fingers. <hi>Muſc.</hi> his quotation of <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2. doth not ſhew us a place wher a baſtard is called <hi>unclean;</hi> or kept out from any Office in the Congregation (as he expounds the place) for any <hi>Ceremoniall uncleanneſſe;</hi> but rather for a kind of <hi>civill maimed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> as thoſe of <hi>naturall maimedneſſe,</hi> ver. 1. Nor is <hi>Muſculus</hi> his reaſon [that if conjugall holineſſe be not here, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. meant, it will bring forth a troubleſome diſpute, how an unbeleeving huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is ſanctified] of any weight. For it is not meant or ſaid, That he is ſanctified in himſelf, but ſanctified in the beleeving wife, to her uſe. As according to <hi>Muſculus</hi> his inſtance of meat; we ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. They are unclean to the unbeleever, pure to the beleever. So is an unbeleeving yoak-fellow, unclean to the unbeleever, clean to the beleever. For the aſſertions of <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> quoted by <hi>Muſculus,</hi> as <hi>Muſculus</hi> is quoted by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>T. [That the ſanctification of the unbeleeving Parent, be not attributed to the faith of the beleeving Parent, but to Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that marriage ſhould be holy.]</hi> We ſay we well know, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:159553:30"/>the Fathers oft too much ſmell of the corruptions of the times in which they lived, in opinions of this nature. Surely the holineſſe of marriage was never appointed to be holy to any, but <hi>to</hi> the firſt and <hi>in</hi> the ſecond innocent <hi>Adam.</hi> And therefore ſo to us onely through faith. Of the other opinion <hi>of things holy by meer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment from God,</hi> are divers dangerous conſequences: one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is; Some affirm that faith as a quality juſtifies, becauſe it is holy for that uſe, by Gods appointment thereunto.

But ſure enough the Apoſtle would never call a meer abſtinence from fornication or adultery, holineſſe. For he ſaith, without faith <hi>All is impure, Tit.</hi> 1.15. And that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. ſignifies more then <hi>lawfully uſed,</hi> as a carnall man may uſe his meat and drinkſoberly and for a good end, to fit him for his calling: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſignifies thus much; That meats, &amp;c. not prohibited, are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Word, allowing them to us, and giving us believing in that Word a right to them in Chriſt, and by the prayer of faith we ſue out a bleſſing upon them.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Objects, That it is not ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.

But helps us to Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> his confeſſion, to agree with us now (contrary to his former ſtruggle) in this, that the unbeleeving husband is not any how ſanctified in himſelfe, or to himſelfe by the beleeving wife; but is ſanctified onely to her. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not ſanctified from any thing common to both: But ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to her <hi>quâ beleever</hi> as ſhee is a <hi>beleever,</hi> and oppoſite to his condition of <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> and therefore her faith hath the onely ſtroke
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:159553:32"/>under Chriſt and his Spirit to ſanctifie the unbeleeving husband as ſanctifying is here meant.</p>
               <p>Thus we have wearyed our ſelves and perhaps the reader in a long anſwer to a large argument. Yet in ſome ſence, <hi>Non ſuns long a quibus nihil eſt quod demere poſſis.</hi> The reſt which Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> ſpeakes to this argument, is built upon this as to be granted (as he ſaith) that <hi>matrimoniall holines</hi> muſt needs be here meant; which we cannot grant, but can overthrow, and we hope have ſo done, though we have not ſaid all that may be ſaid. Only one thing Mr <hi>T.</hi> adds which is not founded upon his imagined ſuppoſition: Namely, whereas <hi>Beza</hi> (ſaith Mr <hi>T.</hi>) inferrs that if matrimoniall holyneſſe ſhould be the ſence of this place, the Apoſtle ſhould draw an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from civill lawes to pacifie conſcience: Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> anſwers that the Apoſtle uſing his Apoſtolicall authority reſolves the doubt in this chapter, and teacheth that according to Gods law, and Chriſts precept, the marriage is not diſſolved by the infidelity of either yoke-fellow, &amp;c. To which we reply, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> could not ſcruple about, not be ignorant of that, which for many ages was notoriouſly divulged throughout the Gentile World, by their civill lawes. They knew well enough who were adulterers and formicators, who not, by their politicke lawes. But their ſcruple is whether conjugall companying with an unbeleever did not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually pollute the beleever. In this the civill or politick lawes of men were ſilent and could not reſolve it: And the rules of civill marriage could not ſatisfie; it being matter of faith.</p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In many of theſe we have ſcarce any thing beſide conjectures which we may follow, neither have I leiſure or books to look into all things which <hi>Commentators</hi> have diſcourſed concerning theſe heads.</p>
               <p>As for the 1 it is ſuppoſed that the bringers were either parents, or other beleevers, who at leſt wiſhed well to the little children; which is probable from the end for which they brought them, to wit, that he might bleſſe them, and pray for them; for this ſheweth faith and love.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond, it is probable they were children of <hi>Iews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was done in the coaſts of <hi>Iudea, Mat.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.1. But whether the parents of the children beleeved in Chriſt or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, is not manifeſt.</p>
               <p>As for the third, concerning the motive, there is little certain, whether it were upon the ſight, or hearing of that which Chriſt did <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.2. or from a cuſtome among the <hi>Iews,</hi> of ſeeking the bleſſing of Prophets and holy men for their little ones, as <hi>Rebekah</hi> for <hi>Iacob, Ioſeph</hi> for his ſons; or from the fame of things done upon the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt; or an inſtinct from God, that occaſion might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of teaching the things that Chriſt taught upon this matter; or ſome other motive.</p>
               <p>As for the fourth, the end is expreſſed by <hi>Matthew,</hi> that he might put on hands and pray; by <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> that he might touch them, which tends to impart a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>As for the fifth, <hi>Matthew</hi> points at the time, by the particle <hi>[then]</hi> and both <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi> put it after the diſſertation with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> concerning divorce, and the anſwer to the Diſciples ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which <hi>Mark</hi> teſtifies was made in the houſe; <hi>Luke</hi> puts it after the parable of the <hi>Publican</hi> and the <hi>Phariſce,</hi> but he is wont to relate things out of their right place. But what the holy Spirit doth intimate, by noting the time preciſely, I gueſſe not, unleſſe perhaps he would have it noted that an occaſion was opportunely miniſtred
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:159553:33"/>of amplifying the argument concerning making a mans ſelf an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch for the Kingdome of heaven, though this reaſon doth not very much like me.</p>
               <p>As for the ſixth, the place is intimated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.1. <hi>in the coaſts of Iudea, beyond Iordan,</hi> in Mat. <hi>By the farther ſide of Iordan,</hi> in Mark; about which it availeth not to our preſent purpoſe to inquire.</p>
               <p>As for the ſeventh, the reaſon of repelling, is not known, but by conjecture, it is probable this bringing of little children, was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to them, either becauſe it did interrupt Chriſts Speech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout marriage, and fitneſſe to the Kingdome of heaven, or becauſe they ſought reſt in the houſe, or becauſe they did think this bringing would be in vain.</p>
               <p>As for the eighth, Chriſt without doubt, was angry with the Diſciples, becauſe they hindred the occaſion of doing good to men, whereas Chriſt went about doing good, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. And in this buſineſſe the faith of the bringers was to be cheriſhed, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of bleſſing in Chriſt was to be manifeſted, and the excellent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be delivered concerning little childrens being capable of the Kingdome of heaven, of the quality of them who receive the Kingdome of heaven; but whether Chriſt would that this fact ſhould remain as a perpetuall rule for baptizing the Infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, is yet a queſtion. It ſeemes ſcarce probable it ſhould be ſo.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Becauſe Baptiſme of Infants, being meerly poſitive, ſo obſcure and doubtfull an inſtitution, is without example and reaſon.</item>
                  <item>2 Becauſe we find no practiſe or hint in Scripture, which may expound this fact to this ſenſe.</item>
                  <item>3 Becauſe, if he had given a command to the Apoſtles of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Infants, he had rather ſaid, bring the little children to me, then ſuffer them to be brought to me.</item>
                  <item>4 He had declared whoſe Infants he would have baptized, and not have ſpoken ſo indefinitely, it is certain, before the command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20.

               </list>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt diſtinguiſh, concerning bringing to Chriſt; there is a bringing to Chriſt, by locall ad motion, there is another bringing to Chriſt by ſpirituall inſtruction; this bringing to Chriſt, is the cauſe of Baptiſme, not the other: for many were brought by the command of Chriſt, to Chriſt, as the blind ſon of <hi>Timaeus,</hi> and others, of whoſe baptiſme, or converſion we read not; for not all that were corporally healed by Chriſt, were alſo ſpiritually healed, as we are to ſay of the nine Lepers, <hi>Malchus,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Argument ſuppoſeth they may be baptized whom Chriſt commands to be brought; but neither is this true of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bringing, for not thoſe whom he commands to be brought ſpiritually are to be baptized, but thoſe whom he hath brought. As for that which is ſaid, that <hi>they are repelled from Chriſt, that are repelled from baptiſme;</hi> It is a light thing, for baptiſme doth not bring men to Chriſt, unleſſe the perſons be firſt in Chriſt. Neither is therefore any man repelled from Chriſt, becauſe he is not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but when he is kept back being ſit for baptiſme. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument therefore is anſwered by denying the <hi>major,</hi> univerſally taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> here reports divers forms of Arguments out of theſe places of Scripture quoted by him,<note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> and ſome of them he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us very lamely formed, and therefore the eaſilier put off by him; but among all, not one ſo formed, as was wont among us, where I have been. I will urge therefore one form which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will break the edge of moſt that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath anſwered here; and then I will conſider what more is conſiderable in his anſwers to the forms he hath ſet down. Our Argument is this.</p>
               <p>To whom indefinitely as <hi>ſuch,</hi> heaven, and the bleſſing of and for heaven belongs, to them as ſuch the ſeal of conveighance, or confirmation of heaven and that bleſſing belongs. For if the land be mine, the deeds and ſeals of conveighance are mine:</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:159553:34"/>
               <p>But heaven and the bleſſing of and for heaven belongs indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to ſuch little children, more, whiles little children; ſo the texts here expreſly. To them belong, or (which is all one) <hi>of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven, and he took them in his arms and bleſſed them.</hi> Therefore to little children indefinitely belongs the ſeal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighance, or confirmation of heaven, and the bleſſing of heaven, which in the New Teſtament, according to the time Chriſt ſpake, is Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Say the Anabaptiſts,<note place="margin">S.D.</note> though it be thus ſaid of theſe little children, yet not of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Therefore we ſaid to little children <hi>indefinitely,</hi> and ſo to be applyed to all <hi>ſuch</hi> as theſe are; as it is ſaid in theſe texts <hi>of ſuch</hi> is the kingdom of heaven, &amp;c. even as election, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel were <hi>indefinitely</hi> ſo and ſo propounded in the Primitive times but to thoſe then; yet by the ſame reaſon as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them, juſt ſo to be applyed to us. Now doubtleſſe THE, or THAT ſame <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> means <hi>ſuch</hi> little children as agreed with the tenor of the Covenant to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham:</hi> namely, little children whoſe parents were repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beleevers.

                     <hi>The doctrine of Baptiſmes, impoſition of hands, and of the reſurrection of the dead, and the laſt judgement</hi> ought to be read conjoynedly, with a certain <hi>Appoſition</hi> (as the <hi>Grammarians</hi> call it) in this ſence; <hi>Not laying again the foundation of repentance, of faith in God, of the reſurrection of the dead, which is the doctrine of Baptiſme, and Impoſition of hands.</hi> Therefore if you include in a <hi>parentheſis</hi> theſe two ſentences, the <hi>doctrines of Baptiſmes</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands,</hi> the context will run more fluently.

For thoſe that were forreigners without, did not come to <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> before they had made a confeſſion of their faith.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:159553:35"/>hands alſo was a certain ſolemn right or manner of praying, of which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks. (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.2.)

For it could not be a principle of the foundation of Chriſtian faith; it muſt therefore be a principle of the foundation of Church eſtate, and order.

               <p>Now let us ſee what is left conſiderable in Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his anſwer to the firſt form of Argument out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. &amp;c. as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the Argument.</p>
               <p>To his poſition (after his long <hi>Analyſis</hi> of theſe places) <hi>That it is a queſtion,</hi> ſcarce probable, <hi>whether Chriſt would have this fact remain as a perpetuall rule for baptizing the infants of beleevers.</hi> We anſwer. That the argument, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> preſents it to us, doth not ſay ſo: but onely intends to ſhew all things to have been in them that were neceſſary to put them into a capacitie, to receive baptiſme. And that they are ſuppoſed here to have been afore baptized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were brought to this higher addition of <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> and <hi>bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:159553:36"/>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his 1, 2, 3, Reaſons of that his concluſion, we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſay, that the argument doth not drive at an <hi>inſtitution</hi> of baptizing infants here that I can perceive in the words.</p>
               <p>To his fourth Reaſon our reply is: It is intimated here that Beleevers infants ſhould be baptized, as we ſhewed but now, in our form of argument from theſe texts. And Chriſt ſpeaks very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. (quoted by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi>) the grand place of Antipaedo baptiſts. When Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith <hi>there is no precept extant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning baptizing Gentiles,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means not abſolutely. For is it not ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. Go baptiſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all the <hi>(Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile) nations,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are not excluded. Or elſe the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts muſt be condemned for baptiſing the <hi>Ennuch,</hi> the <hi>Centurion,</hi> &amp;c. without a rule. Or if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> means no rule extant here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. we have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already, that the words of the argument do not extend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his other expreſſion in this fourth Reaſon, <hi>That there is no precept extant concerning the baptiſing the infants of the Gentiles;</hi> If he means this abſolutely, we have ſhewed the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry already out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and ſhall I truſt ſpeak more. If he means no precept here, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. he ſpeaks not to the argument.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his fifth Reaſon, we ſay that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly rendred, <hi>thoſe</hi> little ones (<hi>iſtos puerulos,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> once hath it). For firſt the article is innumerable times redundant, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervacaneous. Secondly, that if intended for an <hi>emphaſis</hi> here, it would ſound in my eare more harmoniouſly to the ſcope of the text thus; ſuffer thoſe <hi>little ones,</hi> that you deſpiſe, becauſe <hi>little ones;</hi> for I eſteem them; <hi>for of ſuch,</hi> &amp;c. So that the emphaſis relates to their age, <hi>little ones,</hi> not to their number, juſt thoſe and no more. It ayms at their <hi>kind</hi> of condition, not <hi>individualitie</hi> of their perſons. Thirdly, for. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his authority of <hi>Beza,</hi> though in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14. he renders <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>(iſtos puerulos) thoſe</hi> little ones, of which our beſt Engliſh tranſlation takes no notice though the Tranſlators much regarded him, yet the ſame <hi>Beza,</hi> in <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.15. twiſe renders the ſame Greek phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>puerulos,</hi> little children, without any <hi>thoſe</hi> or the like terme.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his ſixth Reaſon out of <hi>Job.</hi> 4.2. it is not to any thing in the expreſſe of argument, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath given it us. For that which follows, that ſome of us ſhould object <hi>that three Evangeliſts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:159553:36"/>rehearſe this fact, that thence a perpetuall rule may be drawn, of bringing infants to Chriſt, by an outward ordinance, which is not done but by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith it is weak for three cauſes he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Our reply is, we could wiſh from our heart, Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> would have quoted where theſe arguments be, if in print. For we hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come by this little time (as dear bought) to give theſe few <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions;</hi> and ſo have none ſuper-abounding to look over all the books in Town of this argument to find a clauſe. Or elſe that Mr. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mles</hi> would preſent us with every argument at firſt in full, that we might know whether it be the ſame mans proſecutions, or whether Mr. <hi>T.</hi> pickt it up elſewhere. I intend not to juſtifie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies; or to make a ſubſtance of every circumſtantiall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that fals from any mans mouth, or pen. Or to ſay he fights with a bilbo-blade, when it is but a bulruſh. But this I may ſay to the particular now in hand, that it is not nothing, that three Evangeliſts rehearſe this fact of Chriſts bleſſing and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing heaven to little children. That ſtill they were brought to him for an outward ordinance, <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> that that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance given to them, did ſuppoſe a former, namely, <hi>Baptiſme</hi> (as we have ſhewed). And therfore if a little child be brought for the firſt ordinance that he as ſuch is capable of (as children were of circumciſion) it muſt be to <hi>baptiſme.</hi> And this may be a rule.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his firſt <hi>cauſe</hi> againſt the objection in his ſixt Reaſon, we ſay onely this, that though 3. Evangeliſts rehearſe the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the palſey man to Chriſt, yet Chriſt doth not bid any to bring him, or further him to him; as he did of theſe little ones when he ſaw them kept off; as knowing he had <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> and <hi>bleſſing</hi> for them, which he had not for many others. Chriſt did not onely cheriſh their <hi>faith</hi> that brought them (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms) but alſo cheriſhed that <hi>baptiſme</hi> the children had received, and as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> confeſſed in the cloſe of his Analyſis, further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted (out of his own mouth) that theſe little ones were capable of heaven. And yet thus much is to be ſaid of the palſy man, that Chriſt ſeeing the bearers of him to uncover the roof of the houſe, yet neither he, nor the owners for his ſake reproving that wrong done, which was a ſpeciall intimation of invitation, it proved in the event, that Chriſt had a great miniſteriall ordinance to be adminiſtred to him, namely, to <hi>pronounce</hi> to him the forgiveneſſe of his ſins, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.9. And from ſuch inſtances as theſe, if Chriſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:159553:37"/>were now upon earth this rule might be drawn, that beleevers children, and poore ſinners ſhould be welcome to him. And if they, or by the help of their friends, ſhewed much deſire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, in their ſpeciall indeavour thereunto, Chriſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, or conniving at their crowding toward him; ſure it would fairly foreſpeak that they ſhould get ſome ſpirituall good by one ordinance or another afore they returned.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his ſecond <hi>cauſe</hi> upon the objection in the fourth Reaſon, we have onely this. Firſt, that if theſe texts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. will form a perpetuall rule for confirmation of children by impoſition of hands; then it will ſuppoſe, that they are firſt baptized. Secondly, that confirmation <hi>as confirmation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">You heard of the original and manner of Scripture im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands afore, though after abuſed in later ages. See <hi>Marlo.</hi> on Hebr. 6.2.</note>, is not <hi>Epiſcopall,</hi> no more then <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of beleevers infants is <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall;</hi> but both are Scripturiall (if I may ſo ſpeak to eccho to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his diſtinction.)</p>
               <p>To the third <hi>cauſe</hi> in anſwer to the objection in this ſixth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon onely this; that this argument may well ſuppoſe that they had been baptized whom Chriſt commanded to be brought to him, and ſo commends this to them, <hi>That theirs is the kingdom of God, and bleſſeth them.</hi> Yea can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf ſuppoſe leſſe then that they were fitter for baptiſme, then many of the Jewiſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for circumciſion. And if fit matter (as is the Anabaptiſts own phraſe) why not to have that for which they are fit.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> O but there was no manifeſtation of their fitneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt manifeſts it of children indefinitely, that of <hi>ſuch is the kingdom of God;</hi> and <hi>to them is the bleſſing.</hi> And if Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to be brought ſpiritually, then ſure his command prevails to make them to be brought ſpiritually. And if any be juſtly repelled from baptiſme (the firſt ſeal) ſure they can be no leſſe then repelled from Chriſt for <hi>that,</hi> and for ſo <hi>long. Matth.</hi> 3. And if baptiſme (taken in its full latitude) as an ordinance of Chriſt may not be ſaid to bring any to Chriſt, to cloſe with him; ſure it cannot be properly ſaid to bring them to Chriſt, after they be in Chriſt; but rather to confirm them in him.</p>
               <p>To his denying the <hi>major;</hi> we ſay the major is univerſally true, if taken according to the <hi>ſence and circumſtances</hi> of the Scripture upon which it is grounded, namely, that Chriſt is moſt willing they ſhould be brought to him, and commands them to be brought, to the end to pronounce them bleſſed, and tels us they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:159553:37"/>are fit for it, heaven being theirs. But if the Propoſition be taken as in the expreſſe of the text, <hi>indefinitely,</hi> there is no univerſall propoſition to croſſe it, as that <hi>no infants may have the firſt ſeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſaith Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> the argument from theſe texts,<note place="margin">Exercit. p. <hi>19</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. for baptizing infants is this. Thoſe whom Chriſt imbraced laid his hands on, bleſſed, may be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: But Chriſt imbraced infants, &amp;c. therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This argument (ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi>) ſuppoſeth theſe acts of Chriſt, to have been all one as if he had baptized. But this is ſaid without proof. In very deed that act of bleſſing <hi>was more then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> and yet it had not the ſame reaſon with baptiſme. <hi>Job.</hi> 4.2. Chriſt did not baptize, but his diſciples. But that bleſſing was an act by which he obteined ſome ſingular gift from God, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for thoſe <hi>infants,</hi> upon whom he laid his hands. Nor is this benefit ſaid to be beſtowed on them for the faith of their parents, but of ſingular favour with Chriſt, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> with his ſiſters, <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, &amp;c. therefore the <hi>major</hi> propoſition is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. For there is no connexion between this fact, which is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and the act of ordinary miniſtery, which is to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, according to the Lords preſcription.</p>
               <p>We anſwer to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his preamble before his anſwer.<note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 That it doth not appear by the argument, nor by report, nor by any thing that I have read, that the Author of this argument or any elſe ever held, that this fact of Chriſt in bleſſing the little ones, &amp;c. was all one with Baptiſme.</item>
                     <item>2 That this fact doth ſuppoſe a fitneſſe in infants for the <hi>leſſer, viz.</hi> Baptiſine, that are fit for the <hi>greater,</hi> namely <hi>bleſſing,</hi> as here (which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> now confeſſed to be greater then baptiſme.)</item>
                     <item>3 This doth ſuppoſe that theſe <hi>infants</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> here cals them) had received baptiſme before they were bleſſed thus by Chriſt. For we find many impoſitions of hands in the Scripture; but conferred on none that I know, but on ſuch as formerly had been baptized, yea ſuppoſed to have grace. See before, in our form of argument on theſe texts of <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. and the learned on <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.2.</item>
                     <item>4 That their baptiſme was beſtowed on them for the faith of their parents, their parents being by all means to be ſuppoſed to be beleevers living in the Church of the Jews and circumciſed; and now they (for who more likely) bringing their children to Chriſt after the Jewiſh cuſtome, as to ſome great Prophet, theſe children after
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:159553:38"/>their baptiſme have this bleſſing beſtowed upon them.</item>
                     <item>5 I do not find where or what that is Mr. <hi>T.</hi> means touching <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his ſiſters, and <hi>John.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> will not find us a place or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular where any were bleſſed by Chriſt, with this ſolemne form of bleſſing, which was not onely by lifting up of hands in prayer; but with laying down of hands upon them; but by all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it preſuppoſeth baptiſme, if not a manifeſtation of grace too.</item>
                     <item>6 Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will not find any impoſition of hands for ſpirituall uſe upon any in the New Teſtament but on ſuch as by all means muſt be ſuppoſed to have been baptized. As in the old Teſtament the Patriarks layed not their hands of bleſſing, but on thoſe that had been circumciſed.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his deny all of the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, as if there were no connexion between this bleſſing and baptiſme. We ſay firſt, there is a connexion in the things, as between the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and the edifice, as between firſt and ſecond, the ſecond ſuppoſing the firſt. And there is a connexion in the argument <hi>à fortiori.</hi> If the greater be done, which is not done till after the leſſer; then the greater ſuppoſeth the leſſer as its introductorie.</p>
               <p>To the touch, that this bleſſing by Chriſt by impoſition of hands was extraordinary:
<list>
                     <item>1 It was not extraordinarie, <hi>that is unuſuall,</hi> for it was cuſtomary with the Patriarks and Prophets to lay on hands, and bleſſe them that had the 1 ſeal, circumciſion.</item>
                     <item>2 If extraordinary ſignifies <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> ſo is every ordinance, both in the inſtitution, and efficacie ſupernaturall.</item>
                     <item>3 If extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie be put here to ſignifie <hi>extraordinary gifts,</hi> above ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſaving grace, or the increaſe of it; there is nothing in theſe texts to make it out. For here is nothing to repreſent the ſame but confirmation of ſaving grace; other miracularie or ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent gifts to act withal, were not given to children, that we read.</item>
                     <item>4 That though impoſition of hands did ſometimes ſignifie and conveigh extraordinary miraculary gifts, and callings to offices upon men; yet <hi>impoſition</hi> did betoken uſually, ordinary grace and things for men and children as we ſhewed afore, and more might be ſhewed out of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.2.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The third Argument which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> preſents to us (as ours) out of theſe texts of <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. is this.<note place="margin">Exerci. p. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> They may be <hi>baptized,</hi> whoſe is the kingdom of heaven. But of <hi>infants</hi> is the kingdom of heaven. <hi>Erge.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:159553:38"/>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>T. Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> (ſaith he) is true, if it be underſtood of thoſe whoſe is the kingdom of heaven, when it appears the kingdom of heaven belongs to them. Secondly, It is not ſaid in the text <hi>[of infants is the kingdom of heaven]</hi> but <hi>of ſuch it the kingdom of heaven.</hi> And Chriſt expounds what he means, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Euk.</hi> 18.17. to wit, of them who in humilitie of mind are like little children, as it is <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.3, 4. but if <hi>[of ſuch]</hi> be to be expounded as <hi>Beza</hi> would annotat in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. <hi>[of theſe and the like]</hi> as above, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. it is not proved from thence that the kingdom of heaven perteins to all infants of beleevers, but to them whom he bleſſed, and to thoſe perſons who either are ſo bleſſed, or are converted, and humble as little children. Whence we deny, firſt, the <hi>major</hi> if taken univerſally. Secondly, the <hi>minor</hi> as it is put indefinitely.</p>
               <p>We anſwer. To what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith in the firſt place.<note place="margin">Animadverſe</note> 1 That Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his anſwer to the <hi>major</hi> is a meer repetition, if not a begging of the queſtion, that none whiles infants are to be baptized?</p>
               <p n="2">2 There was a contrary rule in the old Teſtament, and part of the New, that infants of reputed beleevers ſhould have the firſt ſeal of circumciſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There is no ſuch rule for limitation (as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> mentions) expreſſed in all the New Teſtament, <hi>That none may be baptized till it appeared the kingdom of heaven belonged to them,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> means. For he muſt mean a <hi>certaintie of appearance,</hi> or elſe he ſaith little to purpoſe. For <hi>federall right</hi> was an appearance in the old Teſtament. I have no liſt now to diſpute upon the <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> mentioned <hi>uſually</hi> at the baptizing of men by <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and ſome others: Their <hi>words</hi> ſhort and generall, that <hi>Chriſt was the Son of God;</hi> or that <hi>they were ſinners,</hi> and their <hi>affections cold,</hi> for any good fruits we can find that followed from moſt towards Chriſt all his life time, or to his diſciples, but many times <hi>bad;</hi> ſome called <hi>Diſciples</hi> falling off from Chriſt. <hi>Job.</hi> 6.66. Others ſuch, as though called <hi>beleevers,</hi> yet Chriſt <hi>would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to them, knowing what was in them.</hi> Joh. 2.23, 24, 25. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, Saphira,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> foully falling away anon after their baptiſme. But this I would fain know of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> all things conſidered, firſt, whether there be a rule in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſo many words (as they require for infant baptiſme) touching baptizing people of ripe yeers, and injoyned upon them afore their baptiſme; as may put it out of doubt, or at leaſt make
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:159553:39"/>a cloſe ſpirituall diſcovery, that <hi>to them did belong the kingdom of heaven?</hi> Secondly, whether it be not as good an <hi>appearance</hi> that the kingdom of God belongs to the <hi>infants</hi> of a ſtanding profeſſor (manifeſting his faith by many ſpirituall experiences) becauſe it is ſaid by God, <hi>I am the God of thee, and thy ſeed</hi> (which I truſt Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will acknowledge to be true in the New Teſtament to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving parents to apply it to themſelves concerning their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants) as is that appearance that <hi>the kingdome of God belongs</hi> to a ſudden confeſſour of ripe yeers, that <hi>he is a ſinner,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> that <hi>he deſires to be baptized,</hi> heard and ſeen by mans ſences but ſince yeſterday, or the day before, or a ſhort time ſince? I appeal to the generall practiſe of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in their <hi>re-baptizing,</hi> ſeriouſly to underſtand what I ſay. I know how ſome would heighten that generall confeſſion <hi>that Chriſt was the Son of God;</hi> from the oppoſition made againſt it in Chriſts time. But let them not forget that if this confeſſion by their grant went along with baptiſme, that then it was entertained as well as baptiſme. And the chief Prieſts and Elders of the people durſt not ſay <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme was from men, <hi>For they feared the people</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 21.25. Mar. 11.29.</note>, <hi>leſt the people ſhould ſtone them</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 20.6.</note>. The people were got to ſuch a head, as to hurl away fear of being baptized, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants thereof: multitudes coming from all parts to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. none controuling, that we read, yea the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> alſo offered themſelves to baptiſme, <hi>ibid. Matth.</hi> 3.7. And for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Rulers durſt not take him on the feaſt day for fear of an uprore among the people. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.5. Adde to all, that at <hi>Johns</hi> baptizing the multitudes, there is no mention of any thing, but of <hi>confeſſing their ſins;</hi> and that they might do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhew of danger of perſecution; and many wretched men may do, and have <hi>little right to the kingdom of God.</hi>

<list>
                           <item>1 That <hi>of ſuch</hi> is the kingdom of God, is given as a reaſon why the diſciples ſhould ſuffer little children to come unto him; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> muſt not call Chriſts occaſionall diſcourſes, and alluſions, expoſitions. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.15. For at a civill feaſt he takes occaſion to ſpeak of a ſpirituall eating in the kingdom of heaven; yet this is not the expoſition of that. A multitude of like inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be given. So when Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall not receive the kingdom of God as a little childe, ſhall not enter therein.</hi> It is ſpoken occaſionall, as in a parentheſis, which may be left out, and the ſence of the ſtory of <hi>bleſſing the little children, as to whom heaven did belong,</hi> ſtand full and perfect. Or as that which may be put laſt, as done laſt after Chriſts whole ſpeech and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the little ones, and ſo it is put laſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.17. ſpoken by Chriſt to quip thoſe that kept off the little ones from Chriſt (as eſteeming them, or the motion of bringing them to Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible) as if Chriſt ſaid to them, you had need look to your ſelves that ye be ſo happy as little children, &amp;c. By all which it appears that this ſpeech about men is not of the body, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſolemnitie of bleſſing the little ones, or of the <hi>doctrine</hi> why they ſhould be permitted to be brought to Chriſt, but is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a circumſtance, and <hi>cauſe</hi> made to the ſtanders by. As for <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3, 4. there is not a tittle of Chriſts bleſſing little ones; but the pride of the diſciples occaſioning Chriſt to ſet a childe before them for a <hi>text,</hi> out of which to <hi>preach</hi> humilitie to them.</p>

The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſme examined.</note> it is argued from generall promiſes made to the godly and their ſeed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.2. &amp;c. Whence it is gathered, That God makes a difference between the children of the godly and the wicked; that he promiſeth bleſſing to thoſe, not to theſe; therefore the children of the godly are to be baptized, not the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The promiſes recited, are firſt generall and indefinite: ſecondly, for the moſt part concerning corporall good things; thirdly, with the exception of free Election; fourthly, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with the imployed condition of faith and repentance, and ſo they ſerve not to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>We Reply, to the firſt: If generall and indefinite from God,<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> therefore not to be reſtrained by men from all thoſe God mentions.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, If for the <hi>moſt-part</hi> concerning corporalls, yet Mr T. dares not ſay <hi>altogether:</hi> If ſome ſpirituals meant, it is to the purpoſe: ſecondly, In <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. The judgements there on ſinne muſt needs ſignsfie thoſe that are ſpirituall; therefore, by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, ſpirituall mercies muſt be underſtood. Thirdly, In that 112. <hi>Pſal. v.</hi> 2. To expound that, <hi>The ſeed of the upright ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> that is, <hi>with outward things,</hi> were to ſay they ſhould have no more then what multitudes, if not moſt of wicked mens children have; which in Goſpell-Engliſh were to ſay, they are curſed. <hi>Their table may be made a ſnare, Pſal.</hi> 69.22. And <hi>theſe are the ungodly that prosper in the world, Pſal.</hi> 73.12.</p>
               <p>To the third: That the promiſes to men of ripe years alſo are with the exception of <hi>Free Election.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. Speaking of them that ſtood in oppoſition over againſt rebellious <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fourth, we ſay: firſt, That promiſes muſt be conſiderable in the eyes of men, ſo as to come &amp; waite under the preſſing them, or elſe they will not be comfortable meanes to work actuall faith and repentance in them. Secondly, That Mr T. cannot ſay that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are uncapable of faith: For if <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> whiles a child,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:159553:42"/>was full of the holy Ghoſt; ſure he had that fruit of it, faith, in the habit. And thoſe little ones Ghriſt bleſſed, could not be bleſſed without union with Chriſt, which is by the ſpirit of faith.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, little ones might be brought for other ends then baptiſme, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will uſe the words of <hi>Francis Iunius</hi> in his <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> on the place, All theſe things are ſaid Allegorically, of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall amplification of the Kingdome of Chriſt, as the Prophets are wont; they are fulfilled in the perſwaſions in which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> exhorted their children to imbrace Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We Reply.<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> To the firſt: That Infants in that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.15. were brought for an higher thing then Baptiſme (as we ſhewed, and Mr <hi>T.</hi> confeſſed afore on that Text) therefore might be brought to a lower. <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſme. Secondly, ſure they ſhould bring their children to the congregations of the Churches, to which Kings and Princes ſhall ſubmit ſpiritually (as <hi>Conſtantine, &amp;c.</hi> did) and this the Gentile parents ſhould do, for their children in bringing them, upon the lifting up of Gods hand and Standard; that is, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, (as Mr <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>Iunius</hi> note son that place:) And therefore muſt bring their children whom they were fain to carry in their Armes, and on their ſhoulders, for ſomewhat theſe children might have from the Goſpell, (or elſe as good they had been left at home in the cradle or bed:) And there is no former or lower Ordinance for children then the firſt Seal, as in the Old Teſtament, ſo in the New.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond: The words of <hi>Iunius:</hi> We Reply, firſt, So the Gentiles might exhort their children; but it muſt be long after they ceaſed to carry them in their armes, and on their ſhoulders; when they could more then go of themſelvs. 2. Take <hi>Calvins</hi> words into the ballance with <hi>Iunius.</hi> The Prophet pronounceth, <hi>That the children of the Gentiles ſhould be given to the Church.</hi> But how, if not in and by the firſt Ordinance (if not the leaſt) Baptiſme?<note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. All our Fathers were baptized, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo Infants.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:159553:42"/>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, if this verſe prove that Infants were baptized, the verſes following will prove that they received the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſence is not they were formerly Baptized with the right of Baptiſme begun by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Ordained by Chriſt; but that by a like repreſentation, the ſea and the cloud ſignifie Salvation to them by Chriſt, as Baptiſme doth to us; and that they were in like condition, as if baptized.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid a little to this Text before in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. In reply to Mr <hi>T.</hi> his Anſwer to <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.11. we add,<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> In reply to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his firſt Anſwer. Firſt, That it was not ſo neceſſary, nor ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the ſucking children, that lived on their mothers milk, and the milk of the Heards driven along with them, <hi>ſhould eate Manna and drink water;</hi> as it is infallible that they were <hi>baptized in the red Sea and in the Cloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is ſaid expreſly, They were all baptized in the cloud and in the ſea, but not that they <hi>all ate the Lords Supper,</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Infants did not eate the Manna, and drink the water of the rock; or that there might be no hint for us to carry children to the Lords Supper; but hearken to the rule, <hi>Let him that will eate of that worthily, examine himſelf,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> could prove that the Jews Infants did eate the Lords Supper in the wilderneſſe; it being then not againſt the rule for children that could eate fleſh and bitter herbes (and therefore were of ſome age) to eate the ſecond Sacrament, <hi>the Paſſeover;</hi> yet this makes nothing for Mr <hi>Tombes,</hi> that we ſhould be afraid to ſay They were baptized: For we can ſay boldly That there is no expreſſe command to forbid the <hi>Baptizing of children;</hi> and yet it will not follow that Infants muſt receive the Supper too under the New Teſtament, becauſe there is an expreſſe rule to forbid it.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond Anſwer of Mr <hi>T.</hi> We Reply, firſt, That they were really <hi>baptized</hi> in the cloud and red ſea; and with a Baptiſme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by one greater then <hi>Iohn;</hi> namely, <hi>by that Rock that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, or went along with them, CHRIST,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. And this Baptiſme had the precedency in ſeniority, and of bringing the firſt tydings of the New-Teſtament-Baptiſme. Yea the <hi>cloud</hi> had a capacity to reſemble as wel the baptiſm of the fire of the Spirit (of which the Jews were aware, as appears in the <hi>Rabbins</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary) as of water; and the Sea called the red Sea, being ſo by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:159553:43"/>weeds or other wiſe had an aptneſſe to ſound of, and reſemble blood; and therefore no leſſe fit to be the Symbols or Elements of Baptiſme, then river water now.</p>
               <p>For the two laſt lines of Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> his anſwer. Namely, <hi>[But by a like repreſentation, the ſea and the clould ſignified ſalvation to them by Chriſt as Baptiſme doth to us, and that they were IN A LIKE CONDITION, as if they had been baptized]</hi> We need ſay no more but to thank him for them. For if the <hi>Sea</hi> and the <hi>cloud</hi> ſignified the <hi>ſame ſalvation</hi> by Chriſt, and that <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Text the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 20. is; and that they were in the <hi>like condition as if baptized with New Testament Baptiſme,</hi> and called baptiſme by divine authority; and the Jews are ſaid in regard of it, to be baptized; and that it did repreſent the State of the New Teſtament: I know not what materiall thing can be alleadged to enervate and weaken the Argument, that as the Jews children and Infants were baptized in the cloud and the red ſea; ſo may the children of converted Gentiles be baptized with water under the New Teſtament. Mr <hi>B.</hi> his objection, that it was extraordinary Baptiſme, makes for us. For if the Jews Infants were capable, and did in the Old Teſtament partake of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Baptiſme; then ſure it cannot be denyed to Beleevers Infants in the New.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exercitat.</hi> § 11. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. Examined.</note> from, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. Mr <hi>T.</hi> repreſents to us our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thus. It is ſaid there that Chriſt clenſed the Church, with the waſhing of water, through the word. Therefore Infants either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to the Church, and ſo are excluded from the benefit of Chriſts death; or they are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>T.</hi> his Anſwer is: If this Argument be of force, the theef crucified with Chriſt, and repenting on the croſſe, Infants, <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumeni,</hi> Martyres, &amp;c. dying before Baptiſme, are excluded out of the Church, and from the benefit of Chriſts death. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay, That either the Church is taken for the more famous part of the Church, or that purification is to be underſtood of that which is for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>Our Reply is: Firſt, That the proceſſe of the Argument is not of an impoſſibility preventing Baptiſme; As in the Theef, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Beleevers, <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> (that is, heathens or unbeleevers children catechiſed for Baptiſme) Martyrs, newly converted, that were prevented by death, before poſſibly baptiſm could be duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:159553:43"/>to them. For in ſuch caſes, where an Ordinance cannot be had, God doth ſave without an Ordinance, by his Royall Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: But the Argument proceeds of a voluntary excluſion, upon mans judgement, judging infants of beleevers unfit to be admitted to baptiſme; and ſo theſe abſurdities will follow againſt ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluders. That Infants of beleevers belong not to the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> to them. For theſe go together, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. Where <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> muſt be underſtood of the <hi>Church-policy, Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> not the Common-wealths policy, or elſe Common-wealth muſt be underſtood as including, or twiſted with the Church.</p>
               <p>To Mr <hi>T.</hi> his diſtinction of the <hi>more famous</hi> part of the Church, we Reply. Firſt, it is a venterous ſpeech to ſay that any part of the Church is <hi>infamous;</hi> or to ſay that Chriſt hath no Ordinance, as alove expreſſion, and care for his Lambes, his leſſe famous ones, which is manifeſted in his charge to <hi>Poter, Iohn</hi> 21. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. expreſſed in his welcoming, and bleſſing little ones; and in that, this ſpeech, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. The relative, IT RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERRS to the Church in the former verſe, Chriſt <hi>gave himſelfe for the Church.</hi> Now did not (I pray you) Chriſt give himſelfe for the Infants of beleevers indefinitely?</p>
               <p>To Mr <hi>T.</hi> his diſtinction <hi>[for the moſt part]</hi> we ſay: firſt, That if Mr <hi>T.</hi> can ſo eaſily coine that diſtinction here, why might he not afore, when he ſaid that <hi>all the houſholds,</hi> or the <hi>whole</hi> houſholds <hi>heard the word,</hi> or rejoyced. Secondly, whether or no the many children, that moſt beleevers have, may not be taken in within the <hi>moſt part.</hi> For ſure Mr <hi>T.</hi> doth not mean <hi>purified for the moſt part,</hi> for then he grants a ſuppoſition, That Beleevers and their children are purified in ſome part.</p>

In this ſpeech JOPPOSE NOT THEM WHICH AFFIRME,<note place="margin">Note.</note> THE OUTWARD GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO NATIONALL SYNODS. Secondly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. God ſpeakes not of a priviledge flowing from <hi>birth,</hi> but Obedience. Thirdly, The Epiſtle was written to the diſperſed Jews, and therefore the Argument lies lyable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, when it is drawn from that which is ſaid of the Jewes, as if it were ſaid of the Gentiles. Fourthly, The ſence is, <hi>ye which beleeve,</hi> ver. 7. whom God hath called out of darkneſſe, are a holy Nation, whether <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by ſpirituall regeneration, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are called a family, or kinred, <hi>Epheſs.</hi> 3.15.

               <p>We Reply,<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> to Mr T. his firſt particular, thus: The Argument in my eye doth not proceed to ſuppoſe ſome Nationall Church among the Gentiles. For it doth not ſay [The <hi>Nations</hi> of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers] but [The <hi>Beleevers</hi> of Nations] obtaine the ſame birth privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Beſides, it recites a text written to the <hi>Iewes</hi> who were ſcattered (from being a formall Nation) throughout <hi>Pontus, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Cappadocia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. And when they were a formall Nation, a perſon was not counted a member of that Church <hi>quatenus ipſum</hi> preciſely as he was a <hi>Iew,</hi> but as he was circumciſed, or the Infant of one circumciſed, and ſo to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed alſo. A <hi>Iew</hi> was cut off, if not circumciſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſtitution to <hi>Abrabraham, Gen.</hi> 17. And a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> though a <hi>Gentile</hi> was a member of that Church, if <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,</hi> Ibid. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. Juſt as an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> as an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> was not reckoned a member of the Church, or Churches in <hi>England,</hi> if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be Baptized, but kept out; or a damnable Heretick after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, but was caſt out; or if one be not the Infant of one baptized. Though Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> ſeemes to oppoſe Nationall Churches, yet he ſets them up thus far (wherein thoſe of his judgement in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in hand, I mean the ANABAPTISTS WILL NOT APPROVE Mr <hi>TOMBES</hi>) <hi>That the outward govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church ſhould be SVBIECT to NATIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALL SYNODS.</hi> Nor will Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> pleaſe himſelf
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:159553:44"/>with the direct inference that will follow from his expreſſe words, which inference is this; <hi>That if a Nationall Synod in England, ſhall determine that Infants of Beleevers ſhall be baptized, whiles Infants; Mr.</hi> T. <hi>muſt SVBIECT to it, and lay down all his Exercitat. Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Appendix against the baptizing of beleevers Infants, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vaine, cancelled writings, an old Almanack.</hi> For Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> hath not, in a matter of ſo great conſequence, reſerved to himſelf (by any expreſſe here) ſo much as this exception, <hi>That he will not SVBMIT, in caſe they determine contrary to the Scriptures in his judgement; but that he will have his liberty to ſtand out against the determination.</hi> If any can at the firſt ſight of this, ſuddenly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and Edict by Proclamation, that this exception was <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> it may be as ſuddenly and rationally argued back again, that this would have been ſooner underſtood of the vulgar, and readier been beleeved of the wiſer, if it had been here expreſſed. But if they will have it <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> then the Queſtion will be, firſt: Whether Mr T. according to his deſign, hath prevented all offence to any of whom he would be rightly <hi>understood</hi> touching <hi>Nationall Synods?</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, What greater thing hath he ſaid than divers others, with whom yet he doth not (for ought I know) cloſe in point of Church-Government?</p>
               <p>To Mr T. his ſecond reply, touching <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. That the place being ſpoken to the parents (ſuppoſe upon condition of obedience) doth no way infringe, that the children of thoſe obedient parents, ſhould be counted of that holy Nation, that is, among the reputed holy of that Nation, witneſſe their Circumciſion, and their no-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of diſobedience.</p>
               <p>To the third particular we reply, That this Epiſtle being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the diſperſed Jews, leanes pronly for application to the <hi>Gentile</hi>-beleevers, that though they are as a diſperſed people among the unchriſtian. Chriſtian called-nations, yet their Infants with them are to be accounted (indefinitely) holy, as the children of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Jews were counted holy.</p>
               <p>To Mr T. his fourth particular, we reply, That there is nothing in it that doth evince, that the children of the regenerate ſhould not be accounted federally among the <hi>beleeving Gentiles</hi> of the more more glorious New Teſtament, as among the Jews under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Sixthly it will be anſwered (ſaith M. T.) that the Church of God<note place="margin">Exercitat.</note>

               <p>Mr T. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Church of God may conſiſt without bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as in the crucified converted thief, &amp;c. Secondly, neither perhaps, is it neceſſary to be ſaid, that the baptiſme of Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not lawfull, is therefore <hi>null.</hi> Thirdly, there was in the Church Baptiſme of perſons grown, in all ages: <hi>Ludov.|Vives</hi> in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> upon <hi>Aug. de Civit.

I beare in ſome Cities in</hi> Italy, <hi>that the old cuſtome, for a great part, is yet preſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reply; To the firſt particular. Firſt doth one converted theeſ continue the church?<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> 2 Or if an accident that many by divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiall neceſſity are bolted and debarred from an ordinance for a certain time, doth not interrupt the Churches ſucceſſion, when God by his prerogative will continue it; Can at another time wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neglect of an Ordinance in a right manner, yea the applying of it groſſely to the wrong parties (as the Anabaptiſts pretend both and proclaime thereupon a nullity of Baptiſme of ſuch perſons) juſtifie that then and there is a due ſucceſſion of the Church? Yet thus hath the Baptiſme of beleevers infants ten thouſands for one of ripe years, continued in <hi>Holland, Scotland, England,</hi> and other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> (and where other-wiſe) beyond the memory of the oldeſt man alive: Where then hath been the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church all that while, according to the principles of the Anabaptiſts, touching childrens Baptiſme? Sure they will not hold the preaching of the Word an infallible eſſentiall note of a Church ſo long as whiles Infants grow up to be men. For true preaching of the word of God on the preachers part may be to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Doubtleſſe (as M. P. and <hi>Voſſius</hi> diſtinguiſh;) Wide is the difference of a Church in the <hi>conſtitution</hi> when men of ripe yeares muſt receive the firſt Seale, from a Church <hi>conſtituted,</hi> wherein the firſt Seal deſcends from the beleever to his child for any precept that appears in the Old or New Teſtament to the contrary.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:159553:45"/>
               <p>But Mr T. faith in his ſecond particular (which will nothing pleaſe the Anabaptiſts) <hi>perhaps it is not neceſſary to be ſaid, that the Baptiſme of Infants, becauſe not lawfull is not therefore null.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> Wee reply, Mr T. ſpeakes but <hi>perhaps,</hi> and <hi>it is not neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>to ſay ſo.</hi> But what <hi>perhaps</hi> will M.

               <p>To Mr T. his third particular wherein he <hi>aeſſerts</hi> [That there was in the Church, Baptiſm of perſons grown in al ages] and <hi>quotes L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DOVICVS VIVES</hi> to prove it. We reply firſt to his <hi>aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Firſt that is very generall for an anſwer to an argument; <hi>There were perſons:</hi> How many? <hi>In all ages:</hi> What meanes that? In every <hi>hundred yeares,</hi> or <hi>ordinary age of man:</hi> Suppoſe ſixty years or leſſe? What is all this to clear a continued ſucceſſion of the Church in point of baptizing perſons of ripe years? Secondly, let us deal plainly one with another in things of this nature. Can M. T. or any elſe produce proof that in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> there hath been baptized in either of theſe at leaſt one of ripe yeares every year, for theſe 80 or an 100 yeares laſt paſt: If not, or if ſo, where is a ſufficient number to continue the ſucceſſion of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches we talke of in point of adult-Baptiſme, Baptiſme of perſons of ripe years.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To his quotation of <hi>LVD. VIVES,</hi> we ſay; Firſt he is but of yeſterday to ſay without proofe what hath been in former ages. For in all his Notes on <hi>Auguſt.</hi> he cites not one Scripture, not one
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:159553:46"/>Antiquity, not one Author, nor any thing that may go for a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but only tells us of a faſhion of queſtions put to humane-devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> as they call them; and of an <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> out of <hi>Italy;</hi> a likely place to preſerve any pure truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though <hi>Lud. Vives</hi> were a good Schollar in Arts; yet we muſt not give credit to him in divine things, when his phraſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from purity, and his aſſertion from verity. He ſaith, <hi>Nems olins ſacro admovebatur baptiſterio,</hi> that is, No man of old was brought unto the holy <hi>Baptiſtery, Font,</hi> or <hi>Veſſell</hi> to waſh in. He puts <hi>holineſſe</hi> in or upon the <hi>Veſſell</hi> in which theſe perſons of ripe yeers were baptized (for it ſhould ſeem by him they were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in a River) which phraſe of <hi>Lud. Vives,</hi> Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> covers with a double garment, firſt Tranſlating <hi>Baptisterio</hi> by the word <hi>[place]</hi> that being wide enough in ſignification to include <hi>rivers.</hi> Secondly, Tranſlating <hi>ſacro Baptiſterio [the holy place]</hi> by <hi>[the place of holy Baptiſme]. LVD. VIVES</hi> goes on; <hi>Niſi adulta jam aetate,</hi> that is <hi>unleſſe he were of ripe age already.</hi> Now this is a groſſe miſtake, and oppoſite to the beſt approved antiquity, that tels us it was a known cuſtome in the Churches, to baptize infants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few years after the death of the <hi>Apoſtle John:</hi> And therefore this cuſtome could not totally <hi>invade</hi> the Churches on ſuch a ſudden, without any mention in Antiquity, but flowed doubtleſſe downe from the Apoſtles. So <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, Cyprian, Gregory Natianzen, Ambroſe, Auguſtine, and others.</hi> For the pretences made by Mr T. againſt ſome Quotations of thoſe fathers I doubt not but to take them off and to juſtifie theſe antiquities; when we come in our XIII CHAPTER to Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> his fourth Argument againſt the baptizing of Beleevers Infants. In his <hi>Exercitation</hi> §. 17.

               <p>Ye have alſo before in the ſame 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> of this Controverſie, the words of Mr <hi>Cotton,</hi> and his reading out of Antiquity and his Reaſons, That though young children were baptized, yet were not received to the Lords Supper, and the full fruition of all Church-liberties, till being grown up they made their profeſſion of faith, and ratified their Covenant made in Baptiſme, and ſo were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their Church eſtate, by impoſition of hands: which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands is therefore reckoned one of the ſix principles of the foundation of Chriſtian faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2.

               <p>Thoſe, and no other, the Lord appointed to be baptized, who have been made Diſciples.</p>

               <p>Some one perhaps will ſay that Baptiſme of Infants is elſewhere inſtituted, although not here.</p>

               <p>But Infants may be diſciples, for they may be ſanctified by the Spirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, Infants may be ſanctified by the Spirit of God, purged by the blood of Chriſt, ſaved by the grace of God; my minde abhors from the doctrine of them that aſſert, That Infants not baptized, neceſſarily periſh, or are deprived of the Kingdome of God; nor do I doubt, but that the Elect Infants dying in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are ſanctified; yea, if it ſhould be made known to us that they are ſanctified, I ſhould not doubt that they are to be baptized, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the ſaying of <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have receined the holy Ghost as we?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then you will ſay [make diſciples] in that place, may be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as that it may include Infants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows not; but this onely follows, that in caſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, we may depart from the ordinary rule: But the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rule is, make diſciples, that is, by preaching the Goſpell, make diſciples, as appears from <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. and baptize them, to wit, whom you have made diſciples; and in the ordinary courſe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, we muſt follow the ordinary rule.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſome one will except, that Chriſt teacheth that ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples ſhould be baptized, but that the ſpeech is not excluſive.</p>

               <p>But as for him who gathers from this place, Infants are to be baptized, becauſe Chriſt Commands all Nations to be baptized, verily he is faulty,

               </p>
               <p>To the place of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. That is,<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> the proof of the <hi>Major,</hi> We have anſwered ſomewhat afore, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. of our <hi>Animadverſ. p.</hi> 7. which we intreat the patient reader to ponder over againe; more we have anſwered but now; by comparing, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. who renders it barely <hi>preach the Goſpell;</hi> which the reader cannot but eſteem of more weight then all the interpretations, not onely of all Anabaptiſts, but of all men. We adde now. 1. That this place can argue no more but that the adminiſtration of Baptiſme began <hi>firſt on the parents,</hi> that received the word, and ſo deſcended to their children: they being baptized, their children preſently were baptized alſo. For the Jews generally carried their children with them after Ordinances; whereof we have not onely ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall inſtances, that <hi>Hanna</hi> carried <hi>Samuel</hi> up to <hi>Shilo.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. and <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> carried <hi>Ieſus</hi> to <hi>Hieruſalem, Luke</hi> 2.22. and thus they carried him yeerly at the time of the <hi>Paſſeover, Luke</hi> 2.41, 42, 43. but we have ordinary inſtances.</p>
               <p>As that when the Jews came to the Paſſover and followed Chriſt to hear him preach, and do miracles, they brought their children with them who partook of that they were capable not only of the Paſſeover, but of the diſpenſations of Chriſt: The children partook of the miracle, <hi>Math.</hi> 14.21. compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.4, 5. The children
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:159553:52"/>are offered by their parents and friends that came to hear Chriſt, to have Chriſts hands layd upon them and to be bleſſed of him, and were bleſſed <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. And by the ſame proportion, children are underſtood when it is ſaid <hi>Math.</hi> 3.5, 6. Then <hi>went out to him Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him</hi> (the parents) <hi>confeſſing their ſinnes,</hi> and the children accepted under their confeſſion, being put under <hi>the ſame promiſe, I am the God of thee and of thy ſeed;</hi> even as when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> expreſſed his beliefe in God <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God proclaimed he was his God, and the God of his ſeed, and gave them Circumciſion for a Seal thereof. Nor is all this to be blown away with the blaſt of the word <hi>[uncertain]</hi> unleſſe Mr <hi>T.</hi> could make out hence an expreſſe excluſion of children from Baptiſme, more certain. 2. It cannot bee more then bare preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſay that children that are ordinarily three parts of <hi>All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ſhould be here reckoned as no part of <hi>All nations</hi> here meant, firſt ſeeing <hi>All Nations</hi> are here put as an oppoſite member of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to that <hi>one Nation</hi> of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.41. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. The Gentiles have the Vineyard and were ingraſted as the <hi>Iews:</hi> But the Jews and their children had the benefit of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and both partook of the ſtock according to their capacity and method of Gods diſpenſation. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo the Gentiles. So that whereas afore, the Word and Sacraments were couched within the confines of the Jewiſh nation, and them that came into them, now Chriſt gives a commiſſion to pull down that <hi>partition wall;</hi> and to ſend the Word and Sacraments likewiſe to <hi>All Nations</hi> of the Gentiles, But to the Jewes, the Word and firſt Seal coming to the parents; that Seal came likewiſe to their children: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame proportion is to be kept in the New Teſtament. 2. It is not nothing that it is ſaid <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> and not <hi>Go teach and baptize all Nations.</hi> And therefore the method and order of the phraſe is not ſo cloſely framed to make teaching and baptizing of an exact equall latitude, that only taught diſciples ſhould be baptized; as it might have been if that had been the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Text. For Chriſts inſtitutions are wont to be wonderfull plain in all the things it mainly intends.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We anſwer to the <hi>Minor;</hi> namely [But Infants of Beleevers are not Diſciples.] To which we ſay that it being taken, as here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that Infants of beleevers without exception are no <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:159553:53"/>we eaſily prove it is moſt falſe; by two Texts of Scripture: The firſt we have mentioned afore<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1. of our <hi>Animadv.</hi> p. 8.</note> Namely <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. Now why tempt yee God to put a yoke upon the necks of the <hi>Diſciples?</hi> This yoke was Circumciſion; which was at firſt by Inſtitution put upon children, at eight dayes old. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. According to which the falſe teachers out of doubt as the only ſeeming ſtrength of their <hi>Impoſition</hi> of it did ground it. And therefore purſued it that as the Fathers like <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo the children as <hi>Iſaac &amp;c.</hi> ſhould be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. The ſecond Text is <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.28. <hi>We are Moſes his diſciples</hi> ſay the Jews. But the only thing that entred them into the ſchool of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that firſt nominated them to be <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſciples was Circumciſion in their Infancy which after tyed them to <hi>Moſes</hi> his obſervations, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. Therefore the infants of beleeuers are <hi>Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some will ſay (ſaith Mr <hi>T.</hi>) that Baptiſme of Infants is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where inſtituted.<note place="margin">Exercitat.</note> Let him that can (ſaith he) bring forth that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>We have out of diverſe texts (as clearly and clearlyer then Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath brought forth a prohibition) as out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.<note place="margin">Animadver.</note>

               <p>Yea if it ſhould be knowne to us that Infants are ſanctified,<note place="margin">Exercitat.</note> I ſhould not doubt that they are to be baptized.</p>

               <p>Perhaps (ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi>) ſome one will except,<note place="margin">Exercit.</note> that Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that taught-diſciples ſhould be baptized, but the ſpeech is not excluſive. <hi>Refut.</hi> It is will-worſhip (ſaith he) that follows not the rule. And the Apoſtle in rectifying the buſineſſe of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, brings out onely theſe words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>For I have received of the Lord that which I alſo have delivered unto you.</hi> Beſides as Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.4.8. argues from the inſtitution of marriage againſt Divorce for a light cauſe and polygamie, becauſe it is ſaid, two, not more ſhall be one fleſh. So in like manner it may be here ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Baptizing them,</hi> and not others therefore theſe, and not others, are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>We anſwer. The caſes of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> and marriage were far different from this of <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That as there were clear precedent fore-going inſtitutions of marriage and the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> So to thoſe inſtitutions the words of Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly relate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That therefore thoſe repetitions Mr. <hi>T.</hi> quotes were not the firſt <hi>inſtitutions</hi> of thoſe two, but an <hi>application</hi> of the firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto exact practiſe accordingly to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the occaſion of this repetition of the inſtitution of thoſe two were groſſe abuſes in both, expreſt by the Apoſtle and Chriſt, for which there was no fair pretence; but an apparent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt the firſt inſtitution As that a man ſhould for every light cauſe put away his wife; which was not onely againſt the firſt <hi>inſtitution, Gen.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.32.-19.4, 5, 8. but againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>diſpenſation. Deut.</hi> 24.1. which was not to put her away, unleſſe he found ſome <hi>uncleanneſſe,</hi> that hindred cohabitation according to the intent of marriage. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.8. So likewiſe theſe were groſſe abuſes, firſt, that men at the <hi>communion</hi> ſhould not tarry one for another; but every faction, they of <hi>Paul</hi> by themſelves, they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:159553:54"/>of <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Cephas</hi> by themſelves, and (firſt come firſt ſerved, as we ſay) ſhould partake of the Lords Supper. Secondly, that after their <hi>holy Supper,</hi> ſome that were rich made ſuch large <hi>feaſts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> (which Chriſt inſtituted not) of the <hi>collections,</hi> that they were drunk; whiles the poorer coming after were <hi>hunger-bit,</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſt for them.</p>
               <p>Now for the buſineſſe of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in this 28. of <hi>Matt.</hi> it is quite otherwiſe in all the ſaid three particulars.</p>
               <p>For as for the firſt particular: either as we ſay, in circumciſion was a full and ſufficient foregoing inſtitution of the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſme: and then Chriſt needed not ſay more here but <hi>go teach and baptiſe,</hi> as referring us to the inſtitution of the firſt ſeal <hi>circumciſion</hi> in the old Teſtament. Where after <hi>believing Abraham</hi> was <hi>taught, Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. and after <hi>circumciſed, Gen.</hi> 17. he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>circumciſed his children:</hi> and therefore ſo it ſhould be in the New Teſtament. The parents being <hi>taught</hi> and <hi>baptized,</hi> their <hi>children were to be baptized</hi> alſo. Or elſe (as the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſay) there was no preceding or fore-going inſtitution of baptiſme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts time; and that Baptiſme differs much from Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. But if this be true, how doth this place of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. agree with thoſe quoted places of <hi>marriage</hi> and the Lords <hi>Suppers</hi> there being nothing fore-going this, as there is afore them, to make us punctually underſtand the meaning of it, at leaſt in every main particular; eſpecially in matters of main difference from the adminiſtration of the firſt ſeal of the old Teſtament. And therefore,</p>
               <p>To the ſecond particular we ſay, that if this 28. of <hi>Matth.</hi> be the inſtitution of baptiſme; Firſt, as it doth not agree with the places of <hi>marriage,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> to be an <hi>application</hi> of a former inſtitution of Baptiſme to an exact practiſe; ſo our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt needs have ſpoken plainer and fuller in an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, to have prevented ſo groſſe an abuſe (if it had been abuſe) that men ſhould apply this Sacrament to any infants if to them it ſhould not belong. For how ſhould it be prevented but from the inſtitution at leaſt? And how from the inſtitution, if Chriſt will not there ſpeak it?</p>
               <p>So for the third and laſt particular; as Baptiſme of believers infants hath, you will yeeld, at leaſt a fair religious pretence for it out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. ſo the Lord Chriſt, or <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:159553:54"/>do not in the leaſt intimate any where, that the baptizing of beleevers children was an abuſe, as is intimated about that of <hi>marriage,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> and therefore we cannot attend to any ſuch intention of Chriſt in the leaſt in this of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. to prevent the baptiſme of believers infants.</p>
               <p>Bat Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in his Argument afore out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. objecteth, that if any gather thence that Infants are to be baptized becauſe Chriſt commands <hi>all Nations to be baptized,</hi> that, firſt, he is faultie in caſting away that reſtriction that Chriſt hath put. Secondly, in making the priviledge of believers and their children common to all Infidels and their children.</p>
               <p>We anſwer to the firſt. That firſt, that is the queſtion whether Chriſt hath here put a reſtriction againſt believers children? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that we extend not this place further then to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>taught-or-made diſciples;</hi> underſtanding it to refer to <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where inſtructed <hi>Abraham</hi> was to circumciſe his children; as we ſaid afore. Yet it is ſaid, I will make thee a Father of many Nations; and in thy ſeed all the Nations ſhall be bleſſed. So here though it be ſaid, Go teach and baptize all Nations, yet we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it not beyond the children of <hi>parents taught and baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi> However aſſertors of baptiſme of Infants crack of a priviledge of believers, and their off-ſpring; yet by their <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and <hi>doings,</hi> touching baptizing all Infants, they go far from Chriſts inſtitution, and their own principles at this day, upon which they are now buſie to eſtabliſh Infant-Baptiſme. For their <hi>doings:</hi> firſt, Mr. <hi>T.</hi> urgeth their baptizing all Infants offered to them. For their <hi>ſayings</hi> he urgeth, <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and his quotation out of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Alſo Mr. <hi>S. Rutherford,</hi> Scot; and Mr. <hi>Rathband.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As we did not appoint <hi>Cyprian, Auguſt. John Gerard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Rathband</hi> to ſpeak for us all: So nor do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it. We know as theſe men have and do confeſſe, they are men, <hi>&amp; humanum eſt errare,</hi> man may miſtake. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> aſſumes not to himſelf infallibilitie. If <hi>Auguſt.</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> &amp;c. did erre on the right hand in ſaying <hi>all</hi> Infants may be baptized; yet this doth not inferre, that that is no errour in others that ſay <hi>no</hi> Infants are to be baptized; which erres on the left hand. And though we might excuſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> &amp;c. thus farre, (and yet be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of candid men for ſo doing) that there is not no difference between ſaying, <hi>Grace is not to be denied to any man;</hi> and ſaying, <hi>All
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:159553:55"/>Infants whatſoever are to be baptized</hi> (let them that can, conſult the places of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) yet we ſay rather that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had their ſeverell <hi>naevos,</hi> their blemiſhes in divers things; as <hi>Danaeus</hi> on <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Toſſanus</hi> upon all the Fathers, note them. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was ſo ſenſible of this; that he wrote his <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> to acknowledge the errours of his <hi>life,</hi> and his <hi>Retractations</hi> of his errors in opinion. Who knows but that Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> and that other <hi>H.D.</hi> (that is ſharp with Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> for ſtating the queſtion of baptizing <hi>believers children,</hi> his practiſe and others, as he ſaith, having been formerly larger.) I ſay who knows but Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>D.</hi> formerly have ſo thought, and ſo done themſelves, or at leaſt have not profeſſed againſt it; which now they diſlike in others. Therefore let me offer to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>D.</hi> and others of their judgement, theſe three conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, who that hath eyes (as they <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.) as well within as without, may not arreign himſelf guilty of this encroachment, of extending his practiſe, beyond the rule? In many practiſes he throws open all fences, and turns them into common. But if he be queſtioned by the weakeſt diſputant, he cannot, he dares not juſtifie himſelf in his ſins: but confeſſeth his way is butted there, and bounded here; and all the reſt treſpaſſe againſt the line he ought to walk by.</p>
               <p>Secondly, who is that profeſſor, eſpecially a Miniſter living in this Summer of the Goſpel, at this time of the aſſent of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to our Pole, that forgets how in the dark and ſtormy Winter, he ſaw leſſe, and ſtumbled more? Even many of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedobaptiſts</hi> (whom we own as brethren) if they count Non-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of beleevers children a peece of further Reformation, a ſpark of clearer light, muſt of neceſſitie confeſſe, that not long ſince they thought not, they did not ſo, why then ſhould we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over our brethrens failing? or taunt them for ſetting neerer their meridian, cloſer to the rule? that inſtead of baptizing all children, they now ſtate the queſtion, that onely believers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought to be baptized, unleſſe in ſome ſpeciall caſes, of which after.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though meerly that ſecond nature <hi>cuſtome,</hi> and that whirlwinde of <hi>perſecution,</hi> did precipitate many of later times to baptize all Proteſtant profeſſors children, confeſſing Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, and juſtification to be rooted in his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:159553:55"/>alone, yet all Miniſters did not the ſame upon the ſame principles; But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They knew that very anciently (as appears by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> living <hi>ann. Dom.</hi> 195. which was not long after St. <hi>John.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Not to ſpend time in conſtruing all this, we now onely give you the ſumme of both, in the point now in hand; for we ſhall more largely ſpeak to every particular afterwards. That which they both ſay concerning witneſſes to children, that in theſe ancient times, they were uſed for children whoſe parents <hi>were without,</hi> and not of the faith, not of the Church. We ſpeak not for the uſing of witneſſes or godfathers, &amp;c. in baptizing children as the wont was among us. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this ancient cuſtome (as ancient at leaſt as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>) might poſſibly have ſome reſpect to the Scripture <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. according to Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> obſervation.<note place="margin">His book of the way of the Churche, in N. England. pag. 115.</note> 
                  <q>Baptiſme (ſaith he) may <hi>orderly</hi> be adminiſtred to the children of ſuch parents, as have profeſſed their faith and repentance before the Church. Or where either of the parents have made ſuch profeſſion.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:159553:56"/>ſuch profeſſion, and are ſtill living to undertake for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian education of the childe. For it may be conceived, where there is a ſtipulation of the covenant on Gods part, and a reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation on mans part,<note place="margin">So M.<hi>Grcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> alſo. See his works, where he ſaith the children of unbeleeving parents are within the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their believing grandfathers.

Or if theſe fail, what hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but that if the parents will reſigne their Infant to be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the houſe of any godly member of the Church, the childe may be lawfully baptized in the right of its houſhold go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, according to the proportion of the Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 12, 13.</q> So far Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> both his judgement, and his grounds. Now in imitation of this laſt clauſe, in all likelihood were Witneſſes uſed (though abuſively) in baptizing the children of ſome unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſtrangers from the Church; yet therefore we have not ſuch cauſe to trample upon any of our brethren about their error in baptizing too many Infants; ſeeing they erred with ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and ſome pretence of Scripture before they ſaw this light, for which God muſt be glorified, and not man prided.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing Mr. <hi>T.</hi> objects in this Argument on <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. is, that if this place doth not exclude all Infants from Baptiſme, then nor doth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, <hi>[Let a man examine himſelf; and ſo let him eat]</hi> exclude Infants from the Lords Supper, ſaying by the like eluſion, that the ſpeech of the Apoſtle is not excluſive. Yea verily (ſaith Mr. <hi>T.</hi>) neither will the Argument be of force from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 27. that believers onely are to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>We anſwer. And firſt to that compariſon of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. we reply two things. Firſt, that there is expreſſed in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. an univerſall determinating terme, ſingling out all <hi>communicants,</hi> man by man, that <hi>they muſt be able to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, before they eat.</hi> But there is no ſuch determinating word about <hi>Baptiſine,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. For firſt, we have already in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places of our <hi>Animadverſions</hi> ſhewed, that there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie at all that the Greek word here muſt ſignifie <hi>to-diſciple,</hi> or <hi>make-diſciples.</hi> For firſt, moſt learned men render it no more but <hi>teach.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Tranſlations.<note n="*" place="margin">In the beſt Tranſlations of the French Churches it is <hi>Endoctrinez</hi> teach ye.

                  <hi>Mark</hi> the Euangeliſt alſo renders it, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. onely by <hi>preach.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:159553:56"/>it is evident the word in the Greek is taken divers wayes; and here is no note of circumſtance in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. to prove that it muſt ſignifie to <hi>make-diſciples.</hi> Thirdly, the command is for the Apoſtle to preach to all Nations, though they ſhould not <hi>diſciple</hi> or <hi>diſcipulate</hi> all. If its objected, that if the word in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. according to <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. ſignifies but to teach or preach; yet mention of baptizing immediately follows teaching or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: We anſwer. So is baptizing expreſſed to follow believing, ſaying, <hi>He that beleeveth and is haptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Propoſition, that is in turning it, negatively, it is not ſaid, He that is not baptized ſhall be damned; becauſe Infants (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> confeſſed afore) though of a day old unbaptized may have the ſanctifying Spirit. Therefore may be baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. Our Anſwer then is, that Teaching and baptizing doth not run evenly together.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we now obſerve that the Lord having ſaid, go <hi>preach to all Nations,</hi> he addes, <hi>baptizing them,</hi> indefinitely; not expreſſing <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>ſome</hi> (for <hi>them</hi> doth not in the Greek agree Grammatically with <hi>Nations</hi>) and ſo muſt needs leave us to compare this Text with other Texts afore-written. As with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where though <hi>Noah,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19.2.2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. and <hi>Enoch, Jude v.</hi> 14. had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the old world; yet ſo contrary to teaching were they, that but eight perſons were left alive by the Flood: and of theſe that remained alive, even to, or quite to the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but few were taught-men; as <hi>Noah,</hi> that dyed the yeer before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> birth; <hi>Shem, alias Melchiſedech,</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> father <hi>Terah;</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> few more about this time (<hi>Job</hi> was long after about <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his time) were taught perſons. Now among the theſe taught men, God would to <hi>Abraham</hi> communicate the firſt ſigne or ſeal; and he being ſigned, he ſhould ſigne his children alſo.</p>
               <p>Or with <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> practiſe; who (as it is ſaid expreſly) bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the parents, <hi>confeſſing their ſins,</hi> but doth not exclude (by any expreſſion) their children.</p>
               <p>So then we muſt needs conclude that here is no determinating word in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. to exclude believers Infants. And that this Text doth but give in the <hi>two</hi> main parts of the Apoſtles commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but not expreſly <hi>all</hi> the parts, as the <hi>Adminiſtration of the Communion,</hi> nor all the <hi>main circumſtances</hi> of thoſe two as <hi>touching childrens baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:159553:57"/>
               <p>Secondly, we anſwer to the compariſon of that place of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. with <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> that the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. relates (as the Apoſtle there expreſſeth, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord that which I delivered</hi>) I ſay relates to an expreſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, wherein Chriſt gave the communion to his Diſciples that were of ripe yeers, and not to children. But that place of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. relates to no ſuch expreſſe inſtitution of the firſt ſeal, excluding Infants, but rather refers to ſuch places as do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them, as we ſhewed afore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to that collation or parallel comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 27. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. firſt we reply, that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. declares that <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26, 27. is intended for an excluſion of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from the Communion; but there is no place to declare to us that the meaning of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. is to exclude believers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the firſt ſeal, Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith he will make it appear in the next Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that there are places to declare that <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. did intend the excluſion of believers Infants from Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We ſhall by Gods leave ſhew that there are none to make any ſuch declaration, when by and by we come to anſwer that Argument. Mean while we ſay ſecondly, that there is no other place to ſhew that apparent unbeleevers, whiles ſuch, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the 2. Sacrament; and therefore that inſtitution, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.26, 27. is ſufficient to exclude from the Lords Supper. But we have largely ſhewed that there are no places of Scripture to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Infants</hi> of believers from the firſt ſeal, but many for inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them as belonging to it; and therefore we cannot take that generall expreſſion, <hi>go teach and baptize, Matth.</hi> 28.19. to intend to exclude them from <hi>Baptiſme.</hi>

               <p>That tenet and practiſe which being put, Baptiſme cannot be adminiſtred as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles did adminiſter it,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:159553:57"/>agrees not with the practiſe of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles. But the tenet and practiſe of Infant-Baptiſme being put, baptiſme cannot be adminiſtred as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred it. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We anſwer.<note place="margin">Animadverſ</note> This Argument doth not in terms conclude the thing in queſtion. For make the ſuppoſition that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles, the beſt interpreters of our Lords inſtitution, had never any opportunitie, or occaſion offered to baptize any believers Infants; would it therefore follow that the <hi>inſtitution</hi> did not allow it when it doth not forbid it, but leaves it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the inſtitution of the firſt ſeal in the old Teſtament? <hi>Moſes</hi> the beſt interpreter of the Ceremoniall Law, and ſo of the inſtitution of Circumciſion given by God, had not any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (that we read of to our remembrance) of circumciſing any Jews of ripe yeers; would it follow therefore that he might not have done it according to the inſtitution?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We anſwer. That when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is to anſwer our Argument, that the Apoſtles baptizing whole families, likely baptized ſome Infants, he makes it <hi>doubtfull</hi> whether they baptized any Infants; and now Mr. <hi>T.</hi> puts it <hi>out of doubt</hi> that they baptized none. Or elſe he would prove one doubt by another.</p>
               <p>But let us come particularly to the Argument. The <hi>minor,</hi> namely, [the tenet and practiſe of Infant-baptiſme being put; Baptiſme cannot be adminiſtred as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles adminiſtred is denyed. For it doth not appear that they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized no children. But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will prove the <hi>minor</hi> thus. Before the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> even the Jews did confeſſe their ſins; the Apoſtles afore baptiſme did require ſhews of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12, 13, 37. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.47. <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 17, 18. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15.31, 32, 33. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16. But this cannot be done in the baptiſme of Infants. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We anſwer by limiting the <hi>major.</hi> That in baptizing people of ripe yeers, <hi>de facto</hi> in fact confeſſion of ſin, &amp;c. did precede and forego; But neither <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> nor the Apoſtles make any ſuch expreſſe rule, that <hi>de jure</hi> of <hi>equitie</hi> none ſhould be baptized by them, but thoſe that could make confeſſion of ſin, or profeſſion of faith. Nor doth all the Scriptures brought by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> prove any ſuch <hi>rule.</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf intimatedly confeſſeth, that <hi>John</hi> the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:159553:58"/>Baptiſt did not make <hi>a rule</hi> for confeſſion; but onely in <hi>practiſe</hi> thoſe Jews of ripe yeers that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did baptize, <hi>did firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſins.</hi> And that <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. &amp;c. have been alreadie diſcuſſed that they ſhewed children were baptized; who could not make confeſſion or profeſſion.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> objects, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. <hi>If thou believeſt with thy whole heart thou mayeſt be baptized.</hi> Where the Apoſtle implies in his ſpeech to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that defect of faith was an impediment of baptiſme.</p>
               <p>We anſwer. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> afore confeſſeth, <hi>p.</hi> 24. Infants may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. If therefore he means the <hi>defect of manifeſtation of faith,</hi> we anſwer. It is true in men of ripe yeers. For there it is known that they are worſe then Infants. So was it in circumciſion. If <hi>Iſhmael</hi> be a known ſcoffer, he is caſt out, and ſo his children are not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, unleſſe perhaps after at yeers they gave good teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their due ſubjection to the Law.</p>
               <p>So that to the whole argumentation we ſay, that here is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the manner of the practiſe of that firſt adminiſtration of baptiſme to the parents, with confeſſion and profeſſion by many <hi>examples,</hi> and <hi>intimations,</hi> but not a <hi>rule</hi> ſet down that thus it muſt be in the ſucceſſion of believers children.</p>
               <p>We liſt not to ſpeak any thing more of this <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, and the proofs; onely wonder that among the crowd of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Mr. <hi>T.</hi> quotes, he would thruſt in that of <hi>Act.</hi> 19.5. for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of water, which was onely a conferring of the miraculary gifts of the holy Ghoſt, by impoſition of hands; as many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the place can evince.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> objects this for a confirmation of his Argument. That if it be rightly argued from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. that the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is not to be granted to Infants, becauſe ſelf-examination is pre-required; by like reaſon we may ſay, Baptiſme is not yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Infants, becauſe repentance and faith are pre-required. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. and that of thoſe that deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to whom the promiſe was.</p>
               <p>Beſides what we ſaid afore, we anſwer to this Argument (great in ſhew) that there is not the like reaſon between thoſe places for <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and that for the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> For,
<list>
                     <item>1. That of the Lords Supper ſpeaks of every Communicant <hi>viritim,</hi> as counting one after another; <hi>Let the partie whoſoeuer it be enter into ſelf-examination before eating.</hi> But that <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. ſpeaks in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:159553:58"/>the gub, or generall <hi>to</hi> the <hi>parents.</hi> And that <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. is ſpoken to one onely man, and in that phraſe that cannot be found elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where on that occaſion.</item>
                     <item>2. There is no intimation in the New Teſtament of children admitted to the Lords Supper. But in that <hi>Act.</hi> 2. preſently in the next verſe, <hi>v.</hi> 39. there is an intimation of their Infants admitted to <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> as before we have evinced.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>That clauſe of <hi>deſcending from Abraham, and the belonging of the promiſe, is of no weight</hi> in this Argument. For,
<list>
                     <item>1 The parents by putting to death Chriſt, had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in wickedneſſe worſe then Gentiles.</item>
                     <item>2 That confeſſion and profeſſion is expreſly called for, onely from them that were ſo apparently wicked.</item>
                     <item>3 That if they did come in by repentance, the promiſe (ſaith the Apoſtle) preſently runs to their children.</item>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> is of it ſelf manifeſt. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi> above-recited, to which <hi>Voſſius in the ſibus Hiſtorico-Theologicis</hi> of Infant-baptiſme joyns the teſtimony of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lafridus Strabo,</hi> and by the examining of places brought to that purpoſe, and by the continuation of queſtions propounded to the baptized in Ages following, and others tokens from Councils and Eccleſiaſticall Writers, which in hiſtoricall buſineſſe are wont to beget credit.</p>
               <p>The words of <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> who lived about the yeer, 840. in his book <hi>Derebus Eccleſiaſticis, Chap.</hi> 26. are theſe; <q>We are alſo to note, that in the firſt times the grace of Baptiſme was wont onely to be given to them, who by integritie both of body, and minde, were already come to this, that they could know, and underſtand what profit is to be obteined in Baptiſme, what is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:159553:59"/>to be confeſſed, and believed, what laſtly is to be obſerved of them that are born again in Chriſt. Thus farre Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his quotation of <hi>Walafridus.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>major</hi> we ſay,<note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> that <hi>it is not of it ſelf manifeſt.</hi> For what if we cannot produce any Records of Antiquitie for the uſe and practiſe of many things in the Age next to the Apoſtles; are they therefore doubtfull, when as we have the Word of God for them? Therefore the meer failing of the Votes of humane Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do not make a thing doubtfull: though the Papiſts urge us with the like Argument, that the Proteſtant Churches are not true, becauſe we cannot produce Hiſtories, &amp;c. to ſhew their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in all Ages. If we fail in Records of Antiquitie, we may thank the Papiſts chiefly, who, as we may ſay, martyred by fire, and otherwiſe, as well good books, as godly men: and yet the Truth according to Scripture ſtands where it did.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>minor</hi> we ſay, In generall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tels us beſide of <hi>Lodovicus Vives,</hi> and <hi>Wal.

It were too much to believe every Author upon his bare word, without other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; and therefore by much more too much to believe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors not produced but onely intimated by Mr. <hi>T.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> gives us in, two late-men in compariſon of the ſtream of ancient Antiquitie, which is contrary to thoſe two.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If thoſe two had been a conſiderable number, or had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to us any conſiderable Reaſons, or quotations of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie higher then themſelves, or any fair probabilities, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances how they gather it, they would ſooner have begot credit, then as they are now propoſed.</p>
               <p>In particular, firſt, to <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> we anſwered afore in our Reply to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his 13. <hi>Sect.</hi> touching the Argument of the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Churches ſucceſſion; in the 9.

               <p n="2">2 To <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> who is but of yeſterday in compariſon (by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his confeſſion) to barely aſſert againſt higher appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:159553:59"/>Antiquitie, We anſwer; that if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would but have gone on in the place he quoted out of the 26. Chap. of that <hi>Wal. Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, de Rebus Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> and tranſlated a line or two further, the world might have better ſeen what an acurat Antiquarie that <hi>Strabo</hi> was. We will therefore tranſlate onward immediately where Mr. <hi>T.</hi> left.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For the venerable Father <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (ſaith <hi>W.

Strabo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which, <hi>Ger. Joh.

               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in his <hi>Examen.</hi> objecteth, that it is proved by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> by <hi>Rivet,</hi> and by <hi>Cook,</hi> that the <hi>Queſt. ad orthodox</hi> were not <hi>Juſtin Martyrs,</hi> for as much as they mention not onely <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> but alſo <hi>Origen,</hi> and the <hi>Manichees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We anſwer. Although we will not peremptorily pronounce that thoſe <hi>Queſtions and Anſwers ad Orthodoxos</hi> were <hi>Juſtin Martyrs,</hi> nevertheleſſe it doth not yet appear to us as infallibly proved by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his Arguments, that thoſe <hi>Queſt. ad Orthodox.</hi> were none of his. 1. For the mention of the <hi>Manichees</hi> there is a miſtake. The
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:159553:60"/>place where the <hi>Manichees</hi> are mentioned; is not affirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned men<note n="*" place="margin">Cook. cenſ. patr. Rivet.

Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath it but out of one Author. And very likely it was thruſt in to the <hi>Queſt. ad or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi> in latter times by the Scribes. For the ſence is perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. And the inſerting is but in manner of a quotation, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain how in thoſe times <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> met with ſome opinions then ariſing, which in after-times grew infamouſly famous, got an head, and a <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Manicheiſme:</hi> which being known to the Scribes of latter times, they might put in the name <hi>Maniche,</hi> as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the thing diſputed, and for the information of the Reader. Who that is a Scholar doth not know that Marginall notes on books at laſt have crept into the Text? Many inſtances might be given of books of many ſorts. So then this reaſon is not a certain evincing Argument; that the <hi>Qu. ad. orthod.</hi> are not <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyrs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To the mention of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> we ſay,<note place="margin">Reſp. ad Qu. <hi>115.</hi> ad or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</note> that this Argument is weak alſo. For, firſt, <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> is put in <hi>Anno</hi> 130. after Chriſt. And they ſay he was martyred not till <hi>Anno</hi> 165<note n="*" place="margin">Helvic.</note>. yea ſome ſay not till 169<note n="*" place="margin">Buchol.</note>. And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was a Biſhop <hi>Anno</hi> 170; and therefore muſt needs be famous many yeers before <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> death; and therefore well might they quote one another in their books. But to allow more then Mr. <hi>T.</hi> objects, namely, as ſome object, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in the ſaid place cals <hi>Irenaeus martyr,</hi> when as he was martyred long after <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> death. We anſwer, that if that word Martyr were not put in by ſome late Scribe ſince, for the honour and diſtinction of the man, however in the Engliſh the word <hi>martyr</hi> be taken, yet uſually in Latin, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the <hi>Greek,</hi> it ſignifies onely a <hi>witneſſe.</hi> And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was a famous witneſſe to the truth by pen and profeſſion in <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> time, though not by blood. Again, if <hi>Martyr</hi> be taken for a <hi>ſufferer,</hi> yet not alwayes for a ſufferer by death: <hi>Iſaac</hi> is ſaid to be perſecuted by <hi>Iſhmael</hi> onely mocking him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9. Which kind of oppoſitions, and worſe, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> no doubt met with in thoſe perſecuting times of his, and of <hi>Juſtins,</hi> as fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the effuſion of their blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the mention of <hi>Origen,</hi> in his <hi>Qu. ad orthodox. Reſp. ad qu.</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:159553:61"/>82. <hi>&amp;</hi> 86. we ſay, that <hi>Chronologers</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> (thoſe few we could caſt a look upon) are ſo uncertain about the life and death of theſe two Fathers as is wonderfull.<note place="margin">Bucholcer.</note> It is confeſſed by ſome, that <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> were within ſome 14 or 15 yeers one of another. And we heard afore that ſome made <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> far longer lived then others did; now if indeed (as who knows to the contrary) either <hi>Origen</hi> was born ſooner, or <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> lived longer, but a few yeers; <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> might well hear of <hi>Origen;</hi> who was a great Scholar, very young, even before he was 18 yeers old: and wrote ſoon, and much, in all 7000 books, as <hi>Hieroni</hi> reports.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe for my part (I ſpeak my conſcience) if that be all the objection, I ſhould ſooner believe mens writings quoting one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as ſufficient teſtimonies that they lived ſome yeers at the ſame time when it is neer confeſt by Authors, then to doubt of ſuch becauſe ſome <hi>Chronologers</hi> or Hiſtorians <hi>cipher</hi> or <hi>ſay</hi> them to be 14 or 15 yeers after one another. But where doth theſe Queſtions <hi>ad orthodoxos</hi> quote <hi>Origen?</hi> we can find but two. One in the Anſwer to the 82. <hi>Queſt.</hi> on which let any ingenuous man look and obſerve how <hi>he</hi> is named (if <hi>he,</hi>) in the laſt cloſe of all, and the fulneſſe of the Anſwer, without mention of the ſuppoſed <hi>Origen,</hi> and he will ſay, verily this was but ſome marginall Note ſince <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> thruſt into the Text. The other place is in the beginning of the Anſwer to the 86. Queſtion, and therefore very likely to be thruſted too into the text. For let a man put out the firſt words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>But to give Mr. <hi>T.</hi> an Objection which he doth not make: to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:159553:61"/>wit, that the <hi>Qu. ad orthodox.</hi> are not thought to be <hi>Juſtin Martyrs,</hi> becauſe in them there is ſuch contradictions contrary to what is ſaid in <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi> works (as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>R. Cook</hi> obſerveth) as that in the 52. <hi>Qu. ad orthodox.</hi> it is ſaid the Witch, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. did delude the eyes of all the beholders that they might think it was <hi>Samuel.</hi> But in his <hi>Dialog-cum Tryphone,</hi> the contrary is affirmed. <hi>Qu.</hi> 142. <hi>ad Orthodox.</hi> it is ſaid, that it was a <hi>created</hi> Angel, that talked with <hi>Jacob;</hi> but in his <hi>Dialogue cum Tryphone,</hi> he proves him to be an uncreated Angel.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwer.

               <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> goes on againſt thoſe <hi>Qu. ad orthodox.</hi> Now (ſaith he) what doth this <hi>Bastard Treatiſe</hi> ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are <hi>ſeſquipedalia verba,</hi> high words. For, firſt, by this we have ſaid; it may appear that it is not yet ſo out of doubt that the <hi>Qu. ad Orthodoxos</hi> are not <hi>Justin Martyrs.</hi> Secondly, there are failings enough in the other Treatiſes of <hi>Juſtin Martyrs,</hi> by which theſe <hi>Questions</hi> are judged. Thirdly, that there are not wanting men of great learning that think the ſaid <hi>Questions</hi> may be accounted of <hi>like Authoritie</hi> with the reſt of the Treatiſes, though they were not truly <hi>Juſtin Martyrs.</hi> And <hi>Scultetus</hi> ſaith, that though this Treatiſe be not <hi>Justin Martyrs,</hi> yet not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, there being many <hi>Gemmes,</hi> though mixt with ſome chaffe.

               <p>Well, and what doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay to this Treatiſe which he ſo cals <hi>Bastard?</hi> This: He tranſlated all the whole 56t. Queſtion and Anſwer, named <hi>Justin Martyrs ad Orthodox.</hi>

<list>
                     <item>1 That In thoſe times they did not baptize Infants upon Mr. <hi>Marſhals</hi> ground, namely, upon the Covenant of Grace, made to them and their Infants.</item>
                     <item>2 But they baptized them, becauſe they thought the not-baptized ſhould not obtein good things at the reſurrection, but the baptized ſhould.</item>
                     <item>3 That thoſe baptized Infants obteined thoſe good things by reaſon of the faith of the bringers, what ever the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were.</item>
                     <item>4 That therefore they baptized the children of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, as well as of beleevers if they were brought. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by this tranſlation, and theſe Notes, to bring the Author, and his words into diſgrace, as he himſelf hints it to us.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But we anſwer in generall, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath likewiſe quoted Authors, and among them even his much eſteemed <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> that have had their harſh expreſſions and worſe, as before we have noted. 2. The intent and manner of quoting the <hi>Quest. to the orthodox,</hi> was onely to teſtifie that the baptiſme of Infants was a known cuſtome in thoſe times.</p>
               <p>In particular, we anſwer, firſt to his firſt obſervation, that the ſaid 56. Queſtion, was not urged by my ſelf, or Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to prove baptiſme of Infants upon the ground of the Covenant. But the queſtion being whether in point of <hi>Fact,</hi> the Churches uſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to baptize Infants? to that the quotation of thoſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions named. <hi>Justin Martyrs</hi> was alledged, and to that it ſerveth fitly and fully. For he was a very ancient Author, in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divers learned men. <hi>Sylburgius</hi> thinks that he was a <hi>Juſtin</hi> that might write about the time of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> But <hi>Photius</hi> thinks that it might be <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> interlined by ſome other <hi>Iustin</hi> or other after; as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> dealt by <hi>Origen,</hi> as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> confeſſeth.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſecond obſervation we anſwer. That as we that are <hi>believers</hi> (as it is in the Anſwer to that 56. Queſtion) cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud, nor comfort our ſelves in a willing neglect of baptizing our children according to the Goſpel inſtitution (as we now ſtand to maintain) ſo doubtleſſe we are to expect good things on Gods part to our children according to the intent of Baptiſme. We find it ſo on earth in their comfortable application of baptiſme at
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:159553:62"/>ripe yeers; and why not then to beleeve the fruit of it in heaven, if they dye in childhood? Why may not Baptiſme as well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſuppoſed <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and us, as Circumciſion did the Patriarks concerning their childrens receiving the firſt ſeal. This expreſſion in this 56. Queſtion and Anſwer is eſteemed by <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14. (whom Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſo oft quotes) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To his third obſervation we anſwer. That there is no ſuch clauſe or intimation in the ſaid place of the 56. <hi>Quest. ad orthodox.</hi> as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> here inſerts, namely, [<hi>what ever the parents be</hi>]. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is more probable; the Author calling the <hi>bringers</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants [<hi>beleevers</hi>]. And who ſo likely to bring the children, as the parents. And therefore the parents here moſt probably are thoſe believers. And whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> renders <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> [<hi>worthy</hi>] worthy of good things, he might by warrant from the Goſpel<note n="*" place="margin">As Matth. 10.11. enquire <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, who is <hi>fit,</hi> or <hi>meet,</hi> that is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, as it is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in v. 14.</note> have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it by a more orthodox and fit terme, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>meet</hi>] or [<hi>fit</hi>]. And laſtly, it being more probable then any thing Mr. <hi>T.</hi> can bring to the contrary, that the children were brought to baptiſme by their beleeving parents, and ſo made meet for good things as the fruit of it, let the Reader judge whether all this doth not imply that reſpect here might be had to the Covenant of grace as the ground of baptizing children; which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> but now ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily denyed, as if it were infallibly contrary to the Text of the Author.</p>
               <p>To his fourth obſervation we need ſay no more but that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſpeaks it without all warrant, or ſuch probability from the text of the Author, as there is in it to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now let the world judge whether the words of the Author, conſidering his time, are ſo vain, or ſo impertinent, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would meke them, had they been alledged in full, and beyond that the quotation extended to.</p>
               <p>Thus for <hi>Justin Martyr.</hi> Next we come to <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">IRENAEVS.</note> who lived in the ſame century, namely, in the next age to the Apoſtles, and not at the laſt end of that age neither. For <hi>Bucholcerus</hi> (one of the moſt approved Chronologers by <hi>Vſher</hi>) puts him in the yeer after Chriſt, 178. And <hi>Helvicus</hi> puts him higher, namely, in the yeer,<note place="margin">Testis. D. H. ſecum enutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> 170. And both of them put him down as <hi>Biſhop</hi> at that time (of <hi>Lyons,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bucholcerus</hi>) and therefore was famous no doubt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers yeers afore, and an obſerver of the cuſtomes of the Churches.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:159553:63"/>Having this advantage for that purpoſe, that he was the Scholar of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> as <hi>Polycarp</hi> was Scholar or diſciple to ſome of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as divers Chronologers tell us.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath to our purpoſe in the point in hand, is in his 2 Book, 39. Chap. about the middle. His words are theſe. <hi>Magiſter ergo exiſtens, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <q>Therefore being a teaching Maſter, he had alſo the age of ſuch a Maſter, not refuſing, or going beyond a man, nor diſſolving the law of humane kind in himſelf, but ſanctifying every age by that ſimilitude that was in him to it. For he came to ſave all men by himſelf; All I ſay, who by him are BORN-AGAIN unto, <hi>or,</hi> into God, IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FANTS and LITTLE-ONES, boyes, and young men, and elder men. Therefore he went through every age, and was made an Infant, to Infants, ſanctifying Infants. Among little ones, a little one, ſanctifying them that have this age: being alſo made an example to them of pietie, and juſtice <hi>or</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſubjection. Among young men being made a young man, and ſanctifying them to the Lord; ſo alſo an elder, to the elder, that he might be a perfect teaching maſter, not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the expoſition of truth, but alſo according to age, ſanctifying the elder, being made alſo an example to them. And then he went alſo unto death, that he might be the firſt-born from the dead, holding the primacy in all things, &amp;c.</q> So <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> Whom we have tranſlated above and beneath the place we are to uſe, that there might be the leſſe exception by any, that they could not ſee the coherence and ſcope of the place. The words we ſtand upon in which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> intimates the baptiſme of Infants in that his time, next after the Apoſtles, are, [<hi>All I ſay, who by him are BORN AGAIN unto,</hi> or <hi>into God,</hi> or <hi>according to God</hi> INFANTS, and LITTLE ONES, &amp;c.] The word <hi>Renaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur,</hi> that is, <hi>regenerated,</hi> or <hi>new-born,</hi> or <hi>born again,</hi> ſignifying, or implying <hi>Baptiſme.</hi> So the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſo <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers</hi> mean by <hi>Born-again, new born,</hi> or <hi>regenerated,</hi> though Mr. <hi>T.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scriptures.</hi> The firſt Scripture is in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born again of water and the Spirit.</hi> Where the Spirit ſignifies the inward work, accompanying or following (where God converts) the outward ſigne, ſeal, and conveighance of Baptiſme; as we have before diſcuſſed this place, where we have given you the generall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:159553:63"/>conſent of orthodox Authors, and ſome Reaſons, that the water of Baptiſme is here underſtood. We now adde, firſt, the water of baptiſme muſt be here meant, becauſe of the order: water is put firſt, the Spirit next. Now where a metaphoricall epithite, or word is put to ſet forth the nature of the Spirit, the Spirit is put firſt, and the metaphoricall terme or word after. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Baptized with the holy Ghoſt and fire,</hi> that is, with the holy Ghoſt which is like fire. Secondly, Chriſt is ſpeaking to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> one of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, who did put much in outward, legall, and ceremonious waſhings, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.1, 2, &amp;c. Therefore doubtleſſe Chriſt would apply his ſpeech ſutable to the condition of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> to take him off that waſhing, by propounding to him the Goſpel waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> already begun by <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> on which uſually followed an inward effectuall work of waſhing by the Spirit. Both theſe Reaſons are hinted by <hi>Beza,</hi> who by all means would rather have an <hi>externall</hi> waſhing here meant, beſide the <hi>inward</hi> of the Spirit. And prevents an objection; that grace is not here tyed to the Sacrament of Baptiſme, the peculiar Sacrament of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation (ſaith he) no more then it is to the Lords Supper. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.53. Beſides, ſaith he, there is mention after of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water. Thirdly, regeneration is attributed to the outward and <hi>more common</hi> means of preaching the Word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. why not therefore to Baptiſme the <hi>peculiar</hi> Sacrament of regeneration? And ſo <hi>Nicodemus</hi> hath here for the buſineſſe in hand which is his converſion, all three means compleatly repreſented to him, Chriſts word, Baptiſme, and the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>We liſt not to abound in proof of a thing ſo plain, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received. If one or two think otherwiſe, it is not of weight to ſay ſo without proof. Nor do I know any reaſon why any ſhould diſſent, unleſſe for a dream of tying grace to Sacraments which (<hi>Beza</hi> and others excellently take off) or for fear of mens private intereſts in an argument which is not conſiderable.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture is, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Where waſhing (according to divers learned orthodox Authors) ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies or implyes Baptiſme. The reaſons that evince our conſent is,
<list>
                     <item>1. That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> for waſhing, ſignifies not ſo much the act of bare waſhing, as the place where the water is, and the action is done. For it ſignifies a <hi>Bath</hi> or <hi>laver</hi> of water; and therefore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:159553:64"/>cannot be ſo fitly applyed to the inward waſhing of the Spirit, as to outward baptiſme.</item>
                     <item>2 The ſpirituall working of the Spirit follows in the next clauſe, The making of us new by the Spirit.</item>
                     <item>3 It is uſuall with the holy Ghoſt to call the whole work by the name of the outward ſigne of baptiſme. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. even as Circumciſion is called the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. though but the ſigne or ſeal of the Covenant.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Thus of the Scriptures, that by the words, <hi>born again,</hi> new born, or the like, is ſignified or implyed baptiſme: ſutably to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> takes his own word <hi>Renaſcuntur,</hi> that is, <hi>born again,</hi> or <hi>new born,</hi> to ſignifie <hi>baptiſme.</hi> Compare that place of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. where ſpeaking of the corruptions by Hereticks touching redemption, and Baptiſme, &amp;c. he hath theſe words in the beginning of the Chapter. <hi>This kind</hi> (that is of Sect) <hi>was ſent by Satan for the denying of the Baptiſme of regeneration, or new birth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or according to God, and for the deſtruction of the whole faith.</hi> This place clears the thing, and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his exceptions; which are, 1 poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly this might not be <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his words. 2 That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Latin Tranſlation (we wanting the Greek copie.) To which we anſwer. That this quotation out of the firſt book and 18. Chap. of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> takes away both objections. For Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>Rivet</hi> confeſſeth, That the firſt 27. Chapters of the firſt book of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> are inſerted in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his <hi>Panarium,</hi> which we have in Greek. And ſo much of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> entirely is to be had in Greek in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his works. And accordingly <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>That circumciſion continued ſerving to the time, till the greater circumciſion came, which is the laver of regeneration.</hi> So <hi>Epiphan. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. We have not time to ſeek more; though he ſpeaks often of baptiſme; ſometimes calling it the <hi>great circumciſion,</hi> ſometimes onely the <hi>laver,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> objects,<note place="margin">Mr. T. EXAMEN. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> that <hi>Voſſ. Theſ.

               <p>We anſwer. <hi>Voſſius</hi> doth not ſpeak ſo much for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> but againſt him in this point,<note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> as we conceive. Whether we conceive aright, let the Reader judge. <hi>Voſſius</hi> his words are theſe. <hi>We can prove by apparent teſtimonies of them that lived before the Pelagian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that Infants were baptized.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:159553:65"/>But they were born unclean, as if by this nevertheleſſe he would have it underſtood that the children of beleevers are <hi>[deſignatos]</hi> the deſigned ones of holineſſe, and thereby alſo of ſalvation; that theſe pledges of hope might patronage thoſe marriages, which he had judged to be kept (undiſſolved.) Otherwiſe he had mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lords determination, <hi>Vnleſſe one be born of water and of the Spirit, he ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of God,</hi> that is, He ſhall not be holy. So every ſoul is counted to be in <hi>Adam</hi> till he be recounted to be in Chriſt; and ſo long to be impure, till he be recounted.</q> Thus <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Whence note firſt by the way, how the opinion of Antiquity touching that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his opinion. Secondly, directly to the point in hand of the Baptiſme of the children of beleevers, he holds forth theſe Notions.</p>
               <p>Firſt the <hi>birthright</hi> of beleevers Infants, the parents and children being both under that promiſe, I am the God of thee and thy ſeed. <hi>They are</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>by the Sanctification of one of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, procreated holy, partly by the praerogative of the SEED</hi> (I am the God of thee beleeving <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of thy ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.) <hi>partly by the diſcipline of Inſtitution</hi> (THEREFORE thou ſhalt keep my Covenant to give the firſt ſeal to every male of thy ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. Or <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>The promiſe is to you,</hi> and you being called, to your children alſo.) So that <hi>Tertullian</hi> meanes that the children of beleevers are <hi>reputatively</hi> and <hi>federally</hi> holy: Which is the more plain by that which follows, of <hi>counted in Adam</hi> and <hi>recounted in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The capacity of children, of grace and Salvation (and conſequently of the ſeal, for the deeds and their ſeals follow the right of the inheritance; ſo all along the Scripture, as we have ſhewed in part) I ſay <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhews childrens capacity of grace, 1. In mentioning their being <hi>holy.</hi> For its in vain to talke of account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy, if none may be holy; yea therefore God will have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers children indefinitly accounted holy, becauſe he hath made ſome holy in their childhood, <hi>Iſaac, Iacob, Samuel, Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> thoſe <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. &amp;c. 2. In mentioning that place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5. in relation to children; <hi>Except a man be born again of water and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c.</hi> From all which we may perceive, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> grounds Infant-Baptiſme upon Scripture, not upon unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:159553:66"/>
               <p>Nor is it my opinion onely, that this place of <hi>Tertullian</hi> is for Infant-baptiſme, but of learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> too, (whom Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſo oft quotes with reſpect:) For <hi>Voſſius</hi> by this place proves that it was the mind of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in that noted place of <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Therefore when he ſaith ESPECIALLY CONCERNING LITTLE CHILDREN, that muſt needs be underſtood of the children of ſtrangers or Forraigners, not of the children of thoſe that are in Covenant, and ſo domeſtick or of the family of the Church; as is confirmed by the following Aetiologie

<list>
                     <item>1 as a Tradition not written;</item>

                     <item>3 Without univerſall practiſe;</item>
                     <item>4 Together with the error of giving Infants the Lords ſupper, and many other humane inventions, under the name of Apoſtolicall traditions;</item>
                  </list> That is deſervedly doubtfull.</p>
               <p>But in ſome ages after the firſt from the Apoſtles, the tenet and practiſe of Infant-Baptiſme was in uſe, 1 as a tradition not written, as appears from <hi>Origen, Hom.</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. Of which book neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe let me add the cenſure of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on the Homilies of <hi>Origen</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus, But he that reads this work, and the enarration of the Epiſtle to the Romans, is uncertain whether he read</hi> Origen <hi>or</hi> Ruffinus. And the teſtimony fetched from theſe books for Infant-Baptiſme, is ſo much the more to be ſuſpected, becauſe <hi>Augustine, Hierom, &amp;c.</hi> rely (ſo far as yet is manifeſt to me) on no other teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, then of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his fellow-Biſhops in the Councell, of which mention is made <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 59. <hi>ad Fidum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, out of imitation of Jewiſh Circumciſion, as the doubt of <hi>Fidus,</hi> in the 59. Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Fidus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, though there were alſo other reaſons of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; as the opinion of the neceſſity of Baptiſme to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the greedineſſe to increaſe the number of Chriſtians, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:159553:67"/>perhaps the imitation of heatheniſh luſtration of little ones; and ſome other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, without univerſall practiſe: for it is manifeſt that <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> although borne of <hi>Helena</hi> his mother, a Chriſtian, was not baptized till aged, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the life of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> written by him. The ſame is manifeſt from the booke of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> concerning <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Monica</hi> was a Chriſtian. The things which may be drawne out of <hi>Theodoret, Auguſtine,</hi> and others, concerning <hi>Theodoſius, Alipius, Adeodatus,</hi> and many others (although my bookes and notes out of them are wanting to me, by reaſon of the injury of the times) unleſſe I be deceived, will evince that (though in the Churches of thoſe times, little ones were baptized, yet) many were not baptized, whoſe baptiſme its likely the Church would ſooner have diſpatched, if the opinion of Baptiſme that now obtains, had then obtained.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, together with the error of giving the Lords ſupper to Infants, as is manifeſt out of the booke of <hi>Cyprian de lapſis,</hi> and others. And that many other Inventions of men, under the name of Apoſtolicall tradition, out of a wrong likeing of Judaiſm did then prevail, as the Paſchall ſolemnity &amp;c. is ſo obvious to him that reades Fathers, and Eccleſiaſticall Writers, that no man will need proof. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in very deed, as of old, becauſe the right of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſeemed to be of ſo great moment againſt the Pelagian hereſie, and for the authority of the Councell under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Milevis, Auguſtine, Hierom,</hi> and others, rather then for any ſolid argument out of Scripture in former ages, Infant-baptiſme prevailed; ſo in this laſt age, ſome moderne men ſeeme to imbrace this tenet of Infant-Baptiſme out of horror of mind, leaſt they ſhould go headlong into the pernicious errours of former Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and their madde furies, or leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to deſert the leading-men of the reformed Churches, or move troubles in the Church; rather then from perſpicuous foundation in the Scriptures; which they will thinke that I have not ſaid as one that dreames, who ſhall read what <hi>Robert Lord, Brooke</hi> hath in the end of his Treatiſe concerning Epiſcopacy; <hi>Daniel Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> in his Treatiſe of Baptiſme, and others elſewhere.</p>

Yea, why doth Mr T. without any limitation call circumciſion <hi>Iewish;</hi> as if it had been meerly ſo, when the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>The ſignes and ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> It had been too much for Mr T. to have called it meer <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> or <hi>ceremonious circumciſion,</hi> ſeeing it is the firſt ſeal of the covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> which was <hi>Goſpell</hi> being the main hinge upon which the New Teſtament moves, in the main point of ſalvation by faith in Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in ſending us to Chriſt by faith, urges Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Circumciſion therefore annexed to the covenant, muſt be in diverſe reſpects of the ſame nature; as under the notion of the <hi>firſt ſeal;</hi> in regard of the <hi>ſpirituall ſignification,</hi> inward ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; and too in reſpect of <hi>application,</hi> to teach that ſtill the firſt Seal, as now baptiſm, is to be applyed as to the beleeving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſo to their Infant ſeed; unleſſe Mr T. could have all this while ſhewd us an exception.</p>
               <p>And what if, according to Mr T. his third particular of <hi>[Not univerſall practiſe] Moſes</hi> neglected the circumciſion of his child at the due time, and circumciſion was not exerciſed upon the Jews born in the wilderneſſe for 40 years; and many parts of worſhip could not be uſed in the times of the Churches perſecution; but Churches and their worſhip were hid in corners as <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.

                  <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> to urge the Non-univerſall practiſe of Infant Baptiſm, when many of their fellows have been the cauſe of it.

Therefore I animadvert; Firſt, the Matter is not of conſequence whether there be one or two or three proofes. Doubtleſſe the ingenuous reader may ſee in that Epiſtle, that Infant-baptiſm is argued for, out of Scripture firſt and laſt, &amp; in the middle, &amp; according to the light of the times. And let us bleſſe God for that of their records we have, to ſhew us the practiſe of ancient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in many materiall points. Had we lived in their times, it is a queſtion whether we ſhould have ſeen as much as they did. If we now ſee more its becauſe we dwarfes are ſet upon the ſhoulders of thoſe Gyants. Secondly, that <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epiſtle is not the ſpring-head of Infant-Baptiſme. Firſt, Becauſe that Councell, of which <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeakes in that Epiſtle, did not firſt coyne that opinion as meerly their opinion, depending upon their Votes, but as arguing it (according to their Light) out of the Scriptures.

                  </list> Secondly, becauſe that <hi>Fidus afore</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of this Councell (as it ſeems come) was for baptiſme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants no doubt, from the ground of circumciſion, onely he ſtuck too much on the ceremonie of the eighth day. Thirdly, before <hi>Cyprian</hi> or that <hi>Councell,</hi> were <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clem.

                  <note place="margin">See in the margin after CLEM. ALEXAND.</note> whom we alledge by and by after this. Therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> how ever it ſeem to you, it cannot ſeem to us <hi>that the reſolution of Cyprian with his Collegues</hi> was the ſpring-head of Infant-baptiſme. To the laſt clauſe [therefore all Infants at all times to be baptized] we ſhall ſpeak to in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the next objection.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">EXAMEN. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</note> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> objects againſt <hi>Cyprian</hi> out of that we have tranſlated, that his teſtimony conteins ſome groſſe things, as, firſt, that they thought baptizing, giving Gods grace; and the denying it, the denying of grace. Secondly, they thought that the ſouls were loſt, that were not baptized. Thirdly, that therefore not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Infants of believers, but all Infants were to be baptized. Whence <hi>Toſſanus</hi> in his Synopſis notes this for <hi>Cyprians</hi> error, that he taught, that <hi>Infants were ſtraight wayes to be baptized,</hi> leſt they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, becauſe that the mercy of God is not to be denied them.</p>

               <p>Secondly, in particular we anſwer.

Juſt ſo <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>To the third particular, [that <hi>not onely Infants of believers, but all Infants were to be baptized.</hi>] I find no ſuch paſſage in all <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epiſtle, that <hi>All Infants</hi> are put as the oppoſite member of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, to <hi>believers Infants.</hi> This onely I find, firſt, that <hi>all Infants</hi> are put into oppoſition to <hi>Infants above eight dayes old:</hi> that is, that not onely Infants above eight dayes old, but thoſe under eight dayes old may as well be baptized. As we heard afore in the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Cyprian</hi> in anſwer to <hi>Fidus,</hi> whileſt <hi>Fidus</hi> thought that before the eight day Infants might not be baptized. Secondly, that <hi>all Infants</hi> are put in oppoſition to <hi>believers of ripe yeers</hi> (and therefore moſt likely <hi>all believers Infants</hi> are meant) For ſaith <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> [if greater ſins cannot hinder men of ripe yeers from bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, after they believe, much leſſe may originall ſin onely, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Infant from baptiſme.] So <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> after quotes in this his 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> of his <hi>Examen.</hi> God himſelf he would have all men to be ſaved, yet commands not all ordinances, no nor baptiſme to be given to all men. So <hi>Cyprian</hi> may ſpeak gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the premiſſes, yet intend onely a particular concluſion,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:159553:76"/>that onely ſome Infants are to be baptized, ſutable to the caſe he had in hand.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we anſwer to that of <hi>Toſſanus,</hi> firſt, that there is no ſuch ſentence in all that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath tranſlated, out of this Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> needed not to annex <hi>Toſſanus</hi> his words to that he had tranſlated with a WHENCE, ſaying, whence <hi>Toſſanus</hi> notes this for <hi>Cyprians</hi> errour, that Infants muſt be preſently baptized leſt they periſh, &amp;c. Secondly, that there is no ſuch ſentence in all <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epiſtle, as <hi>Toſſanus</hi> reports; nor to that effect; But onely this, as we tranſlated afore upon another occaſion: That <hi>Cyprian ſpeaking of baptizing Infants though they were not eight dayes old, becauſe the mercy and grace of God is not to be denyed to any born of men,</hi> argueth thus. <hi>Seeing the Lord ſaith in his Goſpel, the Son of man came not to destroy the ſouls of men, but to ſave them, as much as in us is, if it may be, no ſoul is to be deſtroyed.</hi> See here candid Reader, <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth not ſay Infants periſh if they be not baptized. But we ſhould not by wilfull neglect of baptiſme, as much as in us is cauſe them to periſh.</p>
               <p>The reſt that is in Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>Analyſis</hi> of <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epiſtle, is onely againſt Mr. <hi>M.</hi> about querks, and nothing to the point in hand; and therefore needs no anſwer from us.</p>
               <p>Yet thus much we ſay; that wheras Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> would not have it, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth at all put in <hi>originall ſin</hi> among his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the baptizing of Infants; This is clearly intimated by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> That as men of ripe yeers beleeving, are baptized to put away their many greater actuall ſins; ſo Infants are baptized to put away their leſſer, originall ſins.</p>
               <p>And for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his calling this Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> an <hi>abſurd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle;</hi> it is ſomewhat boldly ſpoken, and with too much diſreſpect of ſo famous a man and Martyr in thoſe times; we might have more juſtly have ſaid ſo of divers of the Authors Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but have forborn it, knowing that ſuch words are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futations, but revilings. I am confident that the intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath ſeen that the allegation of <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath not been <hi>abſurd</hi> to the main point now in queſtion; to wit, whether Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was in uſe and practiſe in the Churches in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time; which ſo to have been, <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath fully held out unto us; and ſo Mr. <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>abſurd</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe.<note place="margin">GREG.

And though I conceive with <hi>Grotius</hi> annot. in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14. <hi>that baptiſme of Infants was much more frequented, and with greater opinion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in</hi> Africa, <hi>then in</hi> Aſia, <hi>or other parts of the world, for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Councells you cannot finde ancienter mention of that cuſtome, then the Councell of</hi> Carthage.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:159553:84"/>of perſons of growne age did continue as well as baptizing of infants, till the great darkeneſſe that over-ſpred the Weſterne Churches, ſpoyled by Barbarous Nations, deſtitute of learned men, and ruled by ambitious and unlearned Popes, when there were none to Catechize, and therefore they baptized whole Countries upon the baptiſme of the King of that Country, though both Prince and people knew little or nothing of Chriſtianity, but were in reſpect of manners and knowledge Pagans ſtill, which hath been the great cauſe of the upholding of Papacie, and corrupting of Chriſtian Churches, I meane this great corruption of baptizing, making Chriſtians, giving Chriſtendome (as it is called) afore ever perſons were taught what Chriſtianity was, or if they were taught any thing, it was onely the ceremonies and rites of the Church, as they called them.</p>

And this hath been ſtill the principall ground. The ground that you go on, that the covenant of grace belongs to beleevers and their ſeed, I cannot find amongſt the Ancients. Yea, as you may perceive out of <hi>Perkins</hi> in the place alleadged, although <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 4. book <hi>de Baptiſmo contra Donatiſtas, c.</hi> 22 yeilded, <hi>that either Martyrdome, or the deſire of Baptiſme, might ſupply the defect of Baptiſme,</hi> and ſome of the School-men, <hi>Biel,

               <p n="3">3.

So it is confeſſed by <hi>Maldonat</hi> on <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. that <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, Biſhop of <hi>Rome, held it neceſſary for Infants;</hi> and that this <hi>opinion and practiſe continued about</hi> 600 <hi>years in the Church,</hi> though it be now rejected by the Romane Church in the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. You may conſider, that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> held ſuch a certainty of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining regeneration by Baptiſme, that not onely he puts uſually regeneration for Baptiſme, but alſo he makes no queſtion of the regeneration of Infants, though they that brought them, did not bring them with that faith that they might be regenerated by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace to eternall life; but becauſe by Baptiſme they thought to procure health to their bodies, as is plain by his words, <hi>epiſt.</hi> 23. <hi>ad Bonifacium. Nec illud te moveat, quod quidam non ea fide ad Baptiſmum percipiendum parvulos ferunt, vt gratia ſpiritali ad vitam regenerentur aeternam, ſed quod eos putant hoc remedio temporalem retinere aut recipere ſanitatem: non enim propterea illi non regenerantur, quia non ab illis hac intentione offeruntur; cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brantur enim per eos neceſſaria miniſteria.</hi> By which laſt words you may perceive how corrupt <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was in this matter, ſo as to excuſe, if not to juſtifie their fact, who made uſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in ſo prophane a manner, as to cure diſeaſes by it: which is no marvaile, if it be true which is related, of the approbation that was given of the Baptiſme uſed by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in play amongſt boyes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You may conſider, that in the ſame Epiſtle when <hi>Bonifaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> preſſed <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to ſhew how Sureties could be excuſed from lying, who being asked of the Childs faith, anſwered, <hi>He doth beleeve,</hi> (for even in Baptiſme of Infants they thought in all ages
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:159553:85"/>it neceſſary that a profeſſion of faith go before) He defends that act in this abſurd manner: <hi>Respondetur credere propter fidei Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> and thence he is called a believer, becauſe he hath the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of faith.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe anſwer, ſith the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation was of the Childs faith before it was baptized, and the anſwer was given before, and therefore it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of believing by receiving the Sacrament of faith, which came after.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is apparent out of the ſame Epiſtle, that Infants were then admitted to baptiſme, whether they were the children of believers, or not; it was no matter with what intention they brought them, nor whoſe children were brought; yea it was counted a worke of charity to bring any children to baptiſme, and in this caſe the faith of the whole Church, was counted a ſufficient ſupplement of the defect of the parents or bringers faith: So that whereas the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent defenders of Infant-Baptiſme pretend Covenant-holyneſſe a priviledge of beleevers, it was no ſuch matter in the time of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, but they baptized any Infants, even of Infidels, upon this opinion, That Baptiſme did certainly give grace to them, and if they dyed without Baptiſme, they did periſh. And thus I grant, that it is true, the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is <hi>cited and approved</hi> by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine.</hi> But neither is <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to be approved for approving it; nor doth it advantage your tenet, that you have cited his citation of it: Thus farr Mr <hi>T.</hi> his long anſwer to Mr <hi>M.</hi> ſhort quotation of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee anſwer, and,<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> Firſt to that [<hi>That the Authority of</hi> Auguſtin <hi>was it, which carryed the baptiſme of Infants in the following ages, almoſt without controul</hi>] we anſwer three things. Firſt, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> flouriſhed not till long after the firſt age from that that was next after the Apoſtles; which was the time Mr <hi>T.</hi> ſaid afore wherein baptiſme of Infants began to be in uſe as an unwritten Tradition. For Mr T. ſaith, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> flouriſhed not till 405 or 410 years after Chriſt. So that his authority prevailed not but in his and the times following him. But what was it that carryed the Baptiſme of Infants the 300 or 400 years afore <hi>Auguſtin?</hi> For all that time it was frequent as we have abundantly ſhewed out of good Antiquity. Secondly, if any after were carryed by <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to hold Infant-baptiſme; ſure they heard or read <hi>Auguſtin</hi> arguing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:159553:86"/>the thing by Scripture and divine reaſon<note n="*" place="margin">As againſt the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Pelag. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>. And then doubtleſſe they were carryed by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> he urged; and ſo not by the <hi>authority of the man</hi>
                  <note n="**" place="margin">Mr <hi>T.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth in a matter of 40 lines after, that Councels &amp;c. that did depend on <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on his <hi>Arguments.</hi>
                  </note>. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> himſelfe had taught them better, who in his works profeſſedly rejects ſome of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> when he thought they went not along with the Scriptures. Thirdly, It cannot be ſaid that <hi>Auguſtines authority did in his time carry Infant-baptiſme in a manner without controle;</hi> ſeeing he had ſo much bickering with the <hi>Pelagians</hi> about it who under ſome notion did contend againſt it, as wee ſhewed afore.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To Mr <hi>T.</hi> his quoting of <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> we anſwer firſt, That ſeeing that author is in ſuch credit with Mr <hi>T.</hi> in that he quotes him ſo oft, we expect he ſhould be believed as well <hi>for as</hi> as <hi>againſt us.</hi> Now <hi>Walafridus</hi> is for us, againſt Mr <hi>T.</hi> in theſe things.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That, ſaith he, we read in the laſt book of Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being but a little child, did act the imitation of Baptiſme among his childiſh companions, which being done with recitall of the words that the baptizer did aske, and the baptized anſwered, when thoſe able to ſpeak were baptized: <hi>Alexander</hi> the chiefe Miniſter of <hi>Alexandria</hi> knowing the ſame, judged they ſhould not be re-baptized, but ratified with confirmation. Thus <hi>Walafridus.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. About Infant Baptiſme; which Mr <hi>T.</hi> denies, but <hi>Walafridus Strabo</hi> quotes many authorities and antiquities for it. As that it <hi>In concilio Gerundenſi unius diei infans ſi in diſcrimine ſit baptizari jubetur.</hi> In that <hi>Councill</hi> it was commanded that an Infant one day old, if in danger of death, ſhould be baptized.

                     <item>3. As we noted afore, that <hi>Walfrid</hi> groſſely miſtook in the alleadging that one inſtance of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> For <hi>Walfrid</hi> ſaith in his book <hi>De rebus Eccleſiaſticis</hi> (which we have under our eye) that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reports in his confeſſions of himſelfe that he continued a <hi>Catechumenus</hi> a chatechiſed perſon, till he was 25 years old, before he was baptized; when as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith of himſelfe in his books of confeſſions, that he was not converted till about the thirtieth year of his age, after which he continued a <hi>Catechized one</hi> about two years, in which time he wrote againſt the <hi>Academians,</hi> and wrote his <hi>Soliloquies,</hi> and in his 34 yeer of his age, he was baptized at <hi>Mellain</hi> of <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> You ſee then how little credit is to be given to dreaming <hi>Walafrid</hi> in this point of <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. <hi>Walafrid</hi> confeſſeth that upon the increaſe of diligent ſearch into divine Religion, men of underſtanding in Chriſtian doctrine finding that <hi>peccatum originale Adae. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list> the originall ſin of <hi>Eve</hi> did hold guilty, not onely thoſe that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted actuall ſinne, but thoſe that had not; according to the 51 <hi>Pſalm, in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi> and Rom. 3. <hi>All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> and that <hi>from Adam we had all ſinned, &amp;c.</hi> That upon theſe grounds of <hi>Scripture they,</hi> that is, <hi>thoſe religious men,</hi> baptized their Infants into remiſſion of ſinne. And this practiſe of Infant-baptiſme <hi>Walfrid</hi> judgeth a token of the <hi>growth of Religion.</hi> And alleadgeth <hi>Auguſtins</hi> book of baptiſm of Infants, and the <hi>African</hi> Councills, and the <hi>Fathers</hi> in generall for Infant Baptiſme, againſt that of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> practiſe, baptized at ripe yeares; and withall <hi>Walafrid</hi> ſaith, That thus thoſe wiſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:159553:87"/>Chriſtians did Baptize their Infants into remiſſion of ſinnes, and for regeneration; and not as ſome Hereticall perſons contra-oppoſing againſt the grace of God, contend that Infants are not neceſſarily to be baptized.</p>
               <p>And now I hope I have given Mr <hi>T.</hi> enough of his <hi>Walafrid</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſo oft and confident alleadging him) and have ſatisfied the Reader touching him.</p>
               <p>If Mr <hi>T.</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Walfridus</hi> his mention of the invention of <hi>Goſſips</hi> (as they call them) following upon Infant-Baptiſme, and <hi>ſpirituall</hi> kin of <hi>Goſſips</hi> following upon that, as thereby to blemiſh <hi>Walafridus,</hi> then Mr <hi>T.</hi> breaks his own ſhins. For Mr <hi>T.</hi> did go upon the legs of <hi>Walafridus</hi> to fetch us an antiquity againſt Infant-baptiſm; If Mr <hi>T.</hi> doth but uſe <hi>Walafridus</hi> his antiquity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of thoſe two things: We Anſw. 1. <hi>Goſſips</hi> were long before <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, even in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time many hundred yeers afore. Superſtitions of divers ſorts, crept into the Church ſoon after <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time. And <hi>ſpirituall kin of Goſſips,</hi> is but a novell late dream of yeſter night (in compariſon) of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> falſly ſo called.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That neither of theſe inventions neceſſarily depend on Infant baptiſme, more then a rope of ſand, or pebles in a With: for as much as if beleevers practiſed the baptiſme of their children, it was ſeldome, but one of the Parents were alive in the Infancy of the child. <hi>Kneeling</hi> followed the Communion, and <hi>adoration</hi> of the Elements followed that kneeling; yet theſe do nothing diſparage the Communion it ſelfe in the Inſtitution and ſubſtance of it, but onely defiled the Communicants that ſo ſuperſtitiouſly uſed that ſacred thing.</p>
               <p>Thus of <hi>Walafridus Strabo.</hi> Now of <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> and of <hi>Peter Cluniacenſis</hi> his Epiſtles to two <hi>A. B B.</hi> and two <hi>B B.</hi> againſt him, which are called <hi>Epiſtolae contra Petro-bruſianorum &amp; Heinriciano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum haereſes.</hi> And well may <hi>De Bruis</hi> and <hi>Heinricus</hi> be taxed with Herefie if that be true <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> chargeth upon them. And he profeſſeth twice that he would not accuſe them upon uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and reports; but upon that writing taken from them, and brought to him, wherein he chargeth them as from their own mouths, that they denyed all the Scriptures, eſpecially in the New Teſtament excepting the four Evangeliſts. <hi>Evangelium at ſupra dixi vos ſuſcipere. Epiſtolas Pauli &amp;c. cur non ſuſcipitis? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondetis
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:159553:87"/>quia non adeo certa nobis earum authoritas eſt.</hi> And for this cauſe <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> ſpends two long chapters in proving the Old Teſtament and the New to be the true Word of God, by quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of the four Evangeliſts, which Evangeliſts <hi>Bruis</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> did acknowledge, and <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> goes over all the Bible ſo, book after book, to ſo approve them to <hi>Bruis</hi> and his collegue. But to come to the point in hand of <hi>paedobaptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr <hi>T.</hi> tells us that <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> denyed Baptiſme, but tels us not the reſt that <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> denyed in that very point. Mr <hi>T.</hi> ſhewed us fairly the green graſſe, but not the ſnake lurching in it. Truely I could not but with fadneſſe read <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> of <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> when I found how there as formerly, Mr <hi>T.</hi> takes here and there a touch of Authors that is for his turn, and conceals that which is moſt neceſſarily mixed and twiſted with it; which if Mr <hi>T.</hi> had but intimated, would have overthrown his quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>For Mr <hi>T.</hi> his <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis</hi> gives us the firſt Prepoſition (ſo he calls it) of <hi>Petrus de Bruis</hi> thus: [Mar. 16.15. <hi>Qui cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderit &amp; baptizatus fuerit ſalvus erit, qui verà non crediderit dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabitur.

Nam non alterum horum, fed utrumque pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter ſalvat</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>And a little after this is made more plain,</hi> Nec bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmus ſine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria fide, nec propria fides ſine baptiſme aliquid potuit, Neutrum cuim ſine altero ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. <hi>That is,</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>unde infantes, licèt a vobis baptizentur, quia tamen credere, obſtante aetate, non poſſunt, nequaquam ſalvantur. Non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizamus, ſed baptizamus, quia nunquam baptizatus dicendus eſt qui baptiſmo, quo peèccata lavantur, lotus non eſt:</hi> that is, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>He that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned. Hence it is apparently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi>) that none unleſſe he beleeve and be baptized, that is, hath Chriſtian faith, and receives and perceives Baptiſme, can be ſaved. For not one of theſe alone doth ſave, but both of them joyntly, (ſee the Margin<note n="**" place="margin">Neither could baptiſm without ones own proper faith be ableto do any thing, nor ones own proper faith without bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.

We (ſaith <hi>De Bruis</hi>) do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize, but baptize, becauſe he is never to be ſaid to be baptized, who is not waſhed in the Baptiſme wherewith ſinnes are waſhed away.

                  <list>
                     <item>1. That <hi>De Bruis</hi> did hold, That no Infants, while Infants, can have any faith. Contrary to that, That <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> was filled with the holy Ghoſt, from his mothers womb; which filling, or in being in a ſanctifying manner, is by the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Love, joy, faith, Gal.</hi> 5.

And all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces go together.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>De Bruis</hi> did hold, That all, whether beleevers Infants, or beleevers of ripe yeares, dying unbaptized, are damned. And ſo condemnes many of the Martyrs to hell.</item>
                     <item>3. By this opinion of <hi>De Bruis,</hi> he falſifies the Text he quotes. For though it be ſayd in the affirmative joyntly. He that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; yet it is not ſaid joyntly in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, that unleſſe <hi>One de both beleeve, and alſo be Baptized,</hi> he ſhall be damned; but onely ſinglely, he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned.</item>
                     <item>4. <hi>De Bruis</hi> holds, that God the principall agent, cannot work or doth not work (he wants power or will to worke) the work of mans Salvation without the Inſtrument Baptiſme. So that God is ſtript of his Prerogative, and tyed to meanes.</item>
                     <item>5. That if a man be baptized at ripe years, and that by <hi>De Bruis</hi> or his companion <hi>Heinricus,</hi> they conceiving him to be a beleever, yet if it prove after he was not a beleever, at that baptiſme he is not to be ſaid to have been baptized. So that if after indeed that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, he be baptized, that is no re-baptizing, becauſe his former baptiſm was nothing.</item>

               <p>To this we Anſwer, that the naked truth is this:</p>

Another of <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> his buſineſſes was to prove, That infants might be ſaved while Infants; and accordingly alleadgeth. 1. That as in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> children, whiles children, dyed ſpiritually; ſo children, whiles chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drend. might be made alive ſpiritually in the ſecond Adam <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. That there was not an abſolute neceſſity of a joynt concurrence of baptiſme, with faith in all that ſhould be ſaved, or elſe no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: (For if <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> had not ſpoken to this, he had for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the termes and ſtate of the queſtion:) And therefore urgeth ſome of the Martyrs; and that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>He that confeſſeth me before men, him will I confeſſe before my Father in heaven,</hi> and many other things, that ſome are ſaved without baptiſme, that Martyrdome goes for baptiſme.

               <p n="2">2. That therefore <hi>Auguſtines</hi> authority is not advanced in this point by <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> againſt <hi>De Bruis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>De Bruis</hi> did not appeal to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; nor doth <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> charge it upon <hi>De Bruis,</hi> that he the ſaid <hi>Bruis</hi> being ignorant of the <hi>Greek,</hi> did appeal to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; But as you heard in the tranſlation of <hi>Cluniacenſis,</hi> That he the ſaid <hi>Cluni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acenſis,</hi> profeſſed himſelf a meer <hi>Latine</hi> ignorant of the <hi>Greek.</hi> For <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> makes a ſuppoſition, that perhaps <hi>De Bruis</hi> and <hi>Hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> might deſpiſe the <hi>Greek</hi> Church and other Churches as well as the Latine. Or if perhaps they did not deſpiſe the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> being a <hi>Latine</hi> could not urge them. So alſo in the Tranſlation afore. And there is the leſſe probability that <hi>Cluniacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> ſhould charge <hi>De Bruis</hi> with appealing from the <hi>Latine</hi> Church to the <hi>Greek,</hi> as if it ſided with <hi>De Bruis</hi> in the point of <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme;</hi> For <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> urgeth on his own part the <hi>Greek</hi> Church for Paedobaptiſme againſt <hi>De Bruis</hi> in a generall <hi>historicall</hi> way; thus: <hi>Tota Gallia, Hispania, Germania, Italia, ac univerſa Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa a trecentis, vel quingentis ferè annis, nullum niſi in infantiâ bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizatum habuerit.</hi> That is, <hi>All France, Spaine, Germany, Italy, and all Europe hath not had any baptized for the</hi> 300. <hi>or</hi> 500. <hi>yeers, but Infants.

This paſſage of <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> comming to my eye as I read him, I obſerved after that Mr <hi>T.</hi> ſhould think that <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> charged <hi>De Bruis</hi> with appealing to the <hi>Greek Church</hi> as with him, againſt Infant Baptiſme; When as <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> at moſt doth but intimate that perhaps <hi>De Bruis</hi> and <hi>Heinricus</hi> may not ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily cenſure the <hi>Greek Doctors,</hi> as they had the <hi>Latine.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if they didor did not, <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> was not skilled in <hi>Greek</hi> Doctors to quote and urge them to convert or convince <hi>De Bruis</hi> and his collegue; which to me is an intimation that <hi>Cluniacenſis</hi> had underſtood ſome how, by Latine hiſtory or report, that the <hi>Greek Doctors</hi> alſo were <hi>for Infant Bapiiſme;</hi> or elſe he would not have ſpoken by way of excuſe, that he was onely <hi>a Latine</hi> and not

               </p>
               <p>As for the ſaid Council of <hi>Milevis,</hi> it is true that in their Epiſtle to <hi>P.

               <p>In the ſeventh Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>

                  <hi>alias</hi> a part or 2 Seſſion of the ſixt, we finde but five titles of chapters or canons: But they ſay there were recited 105 whereof a great part were thoſe at the third Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> and in the Council of <hi>Milevis</hi> as they ſay in the title of this ſeventh or ſixth Council. But that which they call the third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> they date in the title to be in <hi>Anno</hi> 438, which was ſaith <hi>Bucholcerus,</hi> 8 years after <hi>Augustines</hi> death. If they mean that Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Milevis</hi> of the ſame 416 year after Chriſt, to them we have anſwered already. If the reſidue of the Canons of this ſeventh Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> are
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:159553:91"/>(as the notes on it tell us and I rather believe) recited in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>African</hi> Council convented in the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celestin;</hi> there indeed that Council is in diverſe Canons againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and <hi>Coelestius</hi> too, and that about baptiſme of Infants which wee mentioned afore at large. But there is no mention at all of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> perſons or rrguments there: and is after that which Mr <hi>T.</hi> Quotes.</p>
               <p>For the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> if Mr <hi>T.</hi> meanes the ſecond. It was too ancient, being under <hi>Siricius</hi> who was <hi>Anno</hi> 385. I ſay too an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be ſwayed by <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (who was not famous according to Mr T. till <hi>Anno</hi> 405. or 410.) againſt <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> if there had been in it any debate about it, as there was none. If Mr T. meane the third Council of <hi>Arles</hi> this was too young and of too later times (being <hi>Anno</hi> 461 or as others 514 under <hi>P. John</hi> 1.) for <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to be there. Nor was there need of his <hi>arguments,</hi> for there are but few Canons, and none about <hi>Pelagianiſme.</hi> It is true one <hi>Fauſtus</hi> writes an Epiſtle to one <hi>Lucidus</hi> a <hi>Pelagian</hi> againſt his Errours which he had vented in a book which <hi>Caeſarinus, Avitus,</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Antiochenus,</hi> confuted in writing; and this Council ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves <hi>Fauſtus</hi> his Epiſtle; in neither of all which is there the leaſt mention (that <hi>I</hi> can find) of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> name or arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> Mr T. think I have not ſaid enough or not punctually to his 3 Councils, and two Fathers, let him blame his non-quotations, and generall and confuſed intimations. Thus of <hi>Fulgentius, Prosper,</hi> and the three Councils.</p>
               <p>Next Mr <hi>T.</hi> objects that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> being counted as one of the four Doctors of the Church, like the four Evangeliſts,<note place="margin">EXAMEN §. 8.</note> his opinion was the rule of the Churches judgement, and the Schooles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; as to the great hurt of Gods Church, <hi>Luther</hi> and others have been of late.</p>
               <p>Anſwer.<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> To that of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> reſpect and authority in matters of diſpute we have ſpoken once and again: that it hath not beene ſo high, as Mr <hi>T.</hi> his elevation.

               <p>But <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">EXAMEN Ibid.</note> ſaith Mr <hi>T.</hi> proved originall ſinne from the <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Infants,</hi> and ſo did the <hi>Council of Milevis</hi> anathematizing

Two Councellours urge the ſame clauſe of a ſtatute, or the ſame deduction thence, clear to both their reaſons, will it follow therefore that the ones judgement depended on the other?</p>
               <p>But ſaith Mr <hi>T.</hi> I value <hi>Auguſtines</hi> judgement,<note place="margin">EXAMEN</note> juſt ſo much as his proofes and reaſon weigh.</p>
               <p>Wee anſwer,<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> That's well: But as we may not extoll good men too much, ſo nor depreſſe an <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> a <hi>Luther,</hi> as if we would by a back blow ſtrike out their eyes, and then ſay they ſaw nothing. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> retractations, and <hi>Luthers</hi> voluntary ſuffering of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loſſes, and croſſes for the truth, are incomparable ſignes they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired not to be high in authority over mens conſciences. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> argued out of the Scriptures plentifully according to his light for that he held; ſo doth Mr <hi>T.</hi> ſo do others. Therefore let us not too raſhly deſpiſe one anothers arguments. The Councill of <hi>Milevis</hi> did Anathematize them that did deny originall ſinne, and perhaps them that ſaid Infants were not baptized into remiſſion of ſinnes; but they do not curſe them that will not make <hi>Infants ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne</hi> an argument for Infant-baptiſme. Sure <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did not ſo <hi>Anathema,</hi> and therefore the <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>Milevis</hi> tooke no ſuch thing from him, and therefore no wonder they doe not practiſe it.</p>
               <p>But Mr <hi>T.</hi> again urgeth the baptiſme of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> at above 30 years old,<note place="margin">EXAMEN §. 8.</note> of <hi>Alipius</hi> his friend, at ripe years, of <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wee anſwer firſt in generall:<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> That they were perſwaded that of <hi>Equity</hi> they ought to baptize all Chriſtians children as the ſtream of Antiquity hath carried it, of which afore abundantly. And Mr <hi>T.</hi> himſelfe chargeth <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that they thought
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:159553:92"/>too many Infants were to be baptized, namely all that had Chriſtian parents or undertakers. If therefore in fact ſome few were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in infancy, it muſt needs be that there was ſome outward forcible ſtop, no inward lett in the judgement. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in fact gave not their children the firſt Seal or ſigne of Circumciſion for 40 years in the wilderneſſe by reaſon of their pilgrimage there ſo long; and God bare with it; though by <hi>equity</hi> they ſhould have done it upon the eighth day after birth upon pain of cutting off, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</p>

               <p>We gave you touches afore, that the fathers writing infinit much, ſpeaking ſometimes in one extream againſt the oppoſites on the one hand, did after in their polemicall dealing with the oppoſites on the other hand, or in a doctrinall way moderate the ſame.

Laſtly, whatever the rigidneſſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was in ſome paſſages touching Infant-baptiſm; the grand point in hand is whether Baptiſme in theſe mens, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fathers times were in practiſe as an unwritten tradition, or as grounded on the Scriptures? And for the latter, thoſe and the reſt of the ancients are full, and to purpoſe, as we have heard.</p>
               <p>For Mr <hi>T.</hi> indeavouring to detract from <hi>Augustine</hi> touching his inferring the neceſſaryneſſe of Infant-baptiſme from <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5.

Do the Papiſts and we agree in no truth? Do not generally all our moſt famous godly and learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> within this laſt hundred years underſtand that very place of baptiſme? And dare any of us in our Pulpits ſay there is not <hi>(neceſſitas praecepti &amp; medy)</hi> a mandatory and inſtrumentall neceſſity of ordinances, that at our perill we may not wilfully ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect them? So that with <hi>Cyprian</hi> afore quoted we conclude, we muſt not as farr as in us lies debarr our poſterity from ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the next objection of M. <hi>T.</hi> is not ſo conſiderable,<note place="margin">EXAMEN §. 8.</note> where he ſaith that <hi>he cannot find among the Ancients for Baptiſme, that ground of ours that the Covenant of grace belongs to beleevers and their Seed.</hi>

               <p>For firſt we demand;<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> muſt not the worthy Ancients be ſaid to hold a tenet upon ſcripture-arguments (for that is the point at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) unleſſe they hold it upon all arguments? 2 We find few of our arguments againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in the Fathers; yet in this we ſide with <hi>Aerius</hi> againſt them; though they condemned him for Hereticall. 3 Antiquity hath ſomewhat of the Covenant of grace in relation to Infant-baptiſme, in the things we have afore quoted. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſets <hi>recounting</hi> in Chriſt, over againſt <hi>counting</hi> in Adam. <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epiſtle tells us in thoſe times they looked to <hi>circumciſion</hi>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:159553:98"/>the Tenet, and practiſe of Baptiſme was in uſe, as a <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not written</hi>] I ſay you have ſeen it proved to be moſt falſe: and have vindicated the Ancients from Mr T. his objections in his EXAMEN.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exercitat.</hi> §. 17.</note> Now let us returne to his Exercitation. § 17.</p>
               <p>Where Mr <hi>T.</hi> will undertake to prove it, that at one time, at leaſt in one place (where <hi>Origen</hi> lived) by one author, to wit <hi>Origen,</hi> that Infant-baptiſm went for an <hi>unwritten tradition.</hi> And for this he quotes only one place, and only quotes it, not giving us the words he intends, in any language.</p>
               <p>But we have given you the place afore in the beginning of this 14 chap. of our Animadverſions,<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> in our quotation of <hi>Origen.</hi> And that place out of him, in his fifth book on the ſixth chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> Mr <hi>T.</hi> quotes here, by the name of <hi>Hom.</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. where we have cleared it, that <hi>Origen</hi> cannot underſtand by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an <hi>unwritten Tradition.</hi> To which we add now that which is very conſiderable to clear the mind of <hi>Origen,</hi> from holding any baptiſme to be a <hi>meer tradition,</hi> namely, <hi>in that he ſpeaks ſo often in his</hi> 6 Hom. <hi>ſuper Ieſum Nave, that Baptiſm (without limitation) is the ſecond Circumciſion. And once hath there theſe words [Sed ex quo venit Chriſtus, &amp; dedit nobis ſecundam circumciſionem, per bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmum regenerationis</hi> &amp;c. that is; <hi>But ſince Chriſt came, and hath given us the ſecond Circumciſion, by baptiſme of regeneration he hath purged our ſouls</hi>]. So <hi>Origen.</hi> So that now Mr <hi>T.</hi> may take his choice: Would Mr <hi>T.</hi> accept of <hi>Origen</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. for his witneſs for an <hi>unwritten tradition of Infant baptiſme?</hi> We have heard his witneſſe, examined him by circumſtances; he ſpeaks no ſuch thing. Or would Mr <hi>T.</hi> impeach, and diſgrace his own witneſſe as not competent, ſaying, <hi>that he is uncertain whether he reads Origen or Ruffinus, that reads that enarration on the Ep. to the Romans;</hi> Why then doth Mr <hi>T.</hi> quote that one place, thereby before the ignorant to aſſay to blaſt all the beſt antiquity, almoſt ſince the Apoſtles, that conſtantly ſay Baptiſme of Infants came from Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and ground it upon ſeverall Scriptures, and divine reaſon? Why did Mr <hi>T.</hi> hang ſo huge a weight on ſo ſmall a wyer? Hee hath produced but one pretended place on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. for himſelf, and that he weakens too with a glance at <hi>Origens</hi> works on <hi>Leviticus,</hi> to prevent our quotation of any thing thence. But as we have given him one place out of <hi>Origen on Levit,</hi> and another out of him on <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. both as they are tranſlated out of the Greek by <hi>Hierom,</hi> as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:159553:98"/>the beſt Editions promiſe us; ſo we have given him a place out of <hi>Origen on Luke,</hi> againſt which Mr <hi>T.</hi> hath made no exception.

                  <q>And though in his child-hood or lad-ſhip, he loved not his learning, and hated to be urged to it, yet there was leſſe feare of him then then when he was a youth<note n="*" place="margin">In adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentia.</note> So in the 12. chap. of that firſt booke of his Confeſſions, Fifthly, After this, before his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme (which was about the 34. yeere of his age as we ſhewed afore) he ranne into blaſphemous errors, in ſo much as his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not admit him to her table, ſo he confeſſeth in his third booke of Confeſſions Chap. 11.</q> And thus you ſee the life of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the cauſes of the delay of his Baptiſme, ſure enough the delay of his and <hi>Conſtantines</hi> baptiſme was not from the cuſtome of the Churches as we have before prooved.

               <p n="1">1. Touching <hi>Alipius</hi> and <hi>Adeodatus</hi> we have anſwered afore.<note place="margin">Animadver.</note> That of <hi>Alipius</hi> is very doubtfull whether he were of Religious Parents; the contrary being more probable, by ſome paſſages out
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:159553:100"/>of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> we have there quoted. And it is doubtfull of <hi>Adeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datus</hi> whether he were baptized at 15. yeeres old as was allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. 2. Touching <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> (for that's the man I ſuppoſe Mr <hi>T.</hi> meanes) it is true that both <hi>Pezelius,</hi> and <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes Scholaſticus</hi> doe tell us that he was baptized at mans eſtate, but they doe not make out that which is deficient in Mr T. his aſſertion, namely whether his Parents, or either of them were Chriſtians when he was an infant. It is true that they ſay he was formerly trayned up in Chriſtianitie. But by the ſtory it ſeemes to me, that Religion did not ſo ceaſe upon his ſpirit, or that he did ſo declare himſelfe againſt <hi>Arrianiſme</hi> and <hi>for the Orthodox</hi> Religion and faith till he fell ſick a little afore his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. For the naked ſtory in ſhort is this. His Collegues <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> the ſecond, his aſſiſtant in many batles, and <hi>Gratian</hi> (who was Partner with <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in a victory againſt the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) being dead, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſucceeded them in the Empire. By ſtock a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> his deſcent from <hi>Trajan;</hi> he had beene formerly trayned up in Chriſtianitie. After the aforeſaid battles, he fell ill, and lay ſore ſicke at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> in which time he deſired to be baptized. Sent for <hi>Anatolius</hi> alias <hi>Aſcholius</hi> the Biſhop of that Church; asked him whether it was lawfull for him to be baptized of an Hereticall Biſhop? The Biſhop an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering that for his part he deteſted the opinion of <hi>Arius,</hi> that <q>he imbraced the faith delivered by the Apoſtles, and ſet forth in the <hi>Nicen Creede</hi> by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> he was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized by him. Then wrote <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to the people of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that he was addicted to the Orthodox Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and exhorted them to conſtantly imbrace the Orthodox faith.</q> Thus the ſtory. Now what inferences Mr <hi>T.</hi> can juſtly make hence for a conſult delay of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his baptiſme, by his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian friends I know not. This hence onely appeares to me, that ſeeing we cannot learne neither how <hi>good</hi> his Parents were at his baptiſme, though <hi>great,</hi> in his infancie (and who ſhall meddle with great mens children in point of Sacraments without their conſent?); nor how long or how much his education in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity had beene in his <hi>youth</hi> (it being unlikely that forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Religion would forward them to be elected <hi>Emperours</hi> in thoſe generally troubleſome and Hetheniſh times) nor what leaſure he had ſeriouſly to thinke of Religion and worſhip in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:159553:101"/>his <hi>young manhood,</hi> the Empire then being full of warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Gothes, Hunnes,</hi> and <hi>Alanes &amp;c.</hi> That that was the onely fit time to baptize him when he was baptized. Now his ſickneſſe made his ſoule well. Now he had leaſure to thinke of Religion for his owne ſoule; now he is hungry for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, now he regarded of what faith Miniſters were; now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Emperour and baptized, he declares himſelf in writing what he was in Religion, and in opinion.</p>
               <p>Therefore for Mr <hi>T.</hi> to infer from the <hi>Contingency</hi> of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his baptiſme at ripe yeare, to a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> that the Churches then thought, ſo baptiſme ought to be adminiſtred, is a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which I never found in my Logick. And if This <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> was about the yeere 401. after Chriſt as the Eccleſ. Chrono. at the end of <hi>Euſeb.</hi> tells us<note n="*" place="margin">Others put him higher.</note> then all thoſe Godly learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients before alleadged for infant baptiſme, from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> to <hi>Auguſtin</hi> had declared their judgements to the world for the ſame, as the Tenet and Practiſe of the Churches in all age of the New Teſtament. And therefore <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and the other few inſtances Mr <hi>T.</hi> hath given of adult baptiſme at ripe yeeres, were rather beſide, then according to the generall Tenet or Practiſe of the Churches anciently and downward: which doe no more infringe the generalily of the Tenet and Practiſe of Infant baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, then the hills and vallyes doe the roundneſſe of the world's which by the Moone we can ſee keepes its exact rotundity. The Moone light of antiquitie can ſhew us that the generalitie of Infant baptiſme hath been all along ſo uniuerſally held and practiſed, that it ſwallowes up a ſmall handfull of inſtances of the other practiſe.</p>

For the proofe, And firſt for that Mr T. doth but intimate in the words, <hi>[and others.]</hi> It is true that in the eighth Sermon upon the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>[This a true ſaying and worthy of all acceptation, &amp;c.]</hi> put among <hi>Auguſtines</hi> workes in the tenth Tome, are theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>Infantes ſunt, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>They are Infants, but they are Christs Members: they are Infants, but they receive his Sacraments:

Sermon with many more of them there on the ſaid words of the Apoſtles be <hi>Augustines</hi> or no. Secondly for that proof, Mr T, expreſſeth the firſt part of it is <hi>here,</hi> out of <hi>Cyprian de lapſis,</hi> quoted by <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in <hi>Epist.</hi> 33. the ſecond part is in his <hi>Examen,</hi> out of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 1 book of merit, and remiſſion of ſin, chap. 20. on the words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.53. and <hi>Maldonat</hi> on <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. who confeſſeth that <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> 
                  <q>held it neceſſary for Infants; and that this opinion and practiſe continued about 600 years in the Church, though it be now rejected by the R. Church in the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi>
                  </q> Thus Mr T. Now we anſwer to theſe things in the Generall thus:
<list>
                     <item>1. That here is produced onely mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>fact,</hi> but no <hi>rule,</hi> ſo much as pretended out of any Scripture, Councell, or any Father for it, by thoſe that uſed it.</item>
                     <item>2. That this <hi>fact</hi> was for about 150 years, From <hi>Cyprian</hi> till <hi>Augustine,</hi> very rare; As before <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Helvie.</note> from whom up to the laſt of the Apoſtles are neer 140 yeers, I finde no mention of it at all in the beſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And for this reaſon it was rarely uſed, becauſe the Ancients upon Scriptures ſwaying them, were all along ſo confident as we have heard that baptiſme alone, was as Ordinance fully ſufficient to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them of the ſalvation of Infants, which cauſed the univerſality of practiſe of Infant-Baptiſme, all along in thoſe times. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. 1.

                  <note n="**" place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſtory in a word is;</hi> That a mayden Infant being made by the Idol worſhippers to ſuck in a little of a bit of bread ſopped in wine, left by them that had there ſacrificed; ſhe being after brought by her mother to the communion, the Deacon forcing into the Infant ſome of the Sacramentall wine, ſhe preſently vomitted, &amp;c. which is taken as a miracle to diſcover the ſinne, before unknown, of her partaking of the Idol-ſop. <hi>Popiſh</hi> Pamelius indeed huggs this ſtory to prove miracles ſince the Apoſtles, and tranſubſtantaition. But for Proteſtants, they maybe rather aſhamed of it, then own it.</note> this wine were given to the child not as <hi>aliment,</hi> but as a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> why was not the Sacramentall bread given to it too? And if it could not ſucke downe a crumme of that bread,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:159553:102"/>as it is ſaid, they gave it the idol-ſop, becauſe it could not ſuck upon the fleſh; how is it ſaid to receive the Lords Supper? For it is ſaid by the Apoſtle, <hi>The bread that we break is the Communion of the body of Chriſt.</hi> We leave this uncertain, and ſimple Teſtimony of Infant Commuuion, in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time. Let us come ſecondly to <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> letting paſſe his weakneſſe in too credulous quoting that weake paſſage in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> his raſh aſſerting that the child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Lords Supper, and his in conſiderate application of it to warne perſons of ripe yeeres of unworthy communicating; whereas more fitly he might have inferred, that it ſhewed what a ſinfull humaine invention it was to force the wine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament into an Infant: I ſay, letting paſſe theſe things in his 23. Ep. Let us conſider what is alleadged out of him, In his book of the <hi>merit and remiſſion of ſinnes,</hi> Chap. 20. upon occaſion of his alledging Iohn 6. To which we ſay. 1. That <hi>Auguſtiue</hi> doth not ſpeake of Infants receiving the Communion as the common Tenet of thoſe times. 2. He brings in ſome diſputing againſt him, that that place of Iohn 6.53. doth not belong to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. 3. When <hi>Auguſtne</hi> weakly endeavours to pull that text to reach to Infants, <hi>from the verb plural, unleſſe yes ſhall eat; and that it muſt belong to children too, or elſe to thoſe only whom Christ there ſpeakes, and not to us alſo in following ages</hi> &amp;c. In the concluſion he ſayth only this; <hi>That fleſh which was given or the life of the world, was given for the life of, LITTLE ONES, and if they SHAL not eat the fleſh of the ſonne of man, nor SHAL they have life,</hi> ſpeaking in the <hi>future</hi> tence, or time. As for <hi>Maldonat</hi> that <hi>Popiſh Calumniator,</hi> I think it nor worth while to turne to him, if I had him; or to believe him if I read him. If <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 1. Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo thought and ſayd, its wonder there were no letters, or Epiſtles between him and his Coeve friend <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> concerning this point too; And that <hi>Boniface</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Innocent,</hi> and was alſo in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, did not mind <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of it, nor <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alleadge <hi>Innocent</hi> to <hi>Boniface</hi> in his 23.

                     <item>1. We have proved Infant baptiſme to be no error, therefore it cannot beget an error in the Adminiſtration of the Holy Supper.</item>

Reſts in a ſong whereby to ſing onely when the concords will beare it, and reſt where not, till they Symphoniſe againe doe not marre, but grace the harmonie.

But for baptizing of beleivers Infants, ſeverall Churches of us doe hold, that we may Baptize them, though neither of thoſe Parents be of our particular Churches.

               <p>
                  <q>There is another fort of them, who only deny <hi>Baptiſme</hi> to their Children, till they come to yeeres of diſcretion, and then they <hi>baptize</hi> them; but in other things they agree with the Church of England.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Truly, Theſe men are much to be pitied; And I could heartily wiſh, That before they be ſtigmatiz'd with that opprobrious brand of <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> the Truth might be clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Anaglogy which <hi>Baptiſme</hi> now hath with <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi> in the old Law, is a fine Rhetoricall Argument, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate a Point well proved before; but <hi>I</hi> ſomewhat doubt, whether it be proofe enough, for that which ſome would prove by it: ſince (beſide the vaſt difference in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,) the perſons to be Circumciſed are ſtated by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law, ſo expreſſe, that it leaves no place for ſcruple: but it is farre otherwiſe in <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> Where all the deſignation of Perſons fit to be partakers, for ought I know, is only, <hi>Such as beleeve.</hi> For this is the qualification that, with exacteſt ſearch, I find the Scripture requires in perſons to be <hi>baptized:</hi> And <hi>This</hi> it ſeemes to require in All ſuch perſons. Now, how Infants can be properly ſaid to <hi>beleeve,</hi> I am not yet fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Yet many things prevaile very much with me in this point.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Firſt, For ought I could ever learne, It was the conſtant cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the pureſt and moſt Primitive Church, to baptize <hi>Infants</hi> of beleeving Parents; For I could never find the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and firſt Riſe of this practiſe: Whereas it is very eaſie to tracke Hereſies to their firſt Riſing up, and ſetting foot in the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Againe, I find all Churches (even the moſt ſtrict) have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beene of this judgement and practiſe: yea though
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:159553:105"/>there have beene in all ages ſome, that much affected novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had parts enough to diſcuſſe and cleere what they thought good to preach; yet was this ſcarce ever queſtioned by men of Note, till within theſe Laſt Ages. And ſure, the conſtant judgement of the Churches of Chriſt, is much to be honoured, and heard in all things that contradict not Scripture.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Nor can I well cleere that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.) <hi>Elſe were your Children <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleane, but now are they Holy.</hi> I know ſome interpret it thus, <hi>If it be unlawfull for a beleever to live in wedlock with one that beleeveth not; Then have many of you lived a long time in unlawfull marriage; and ſo your very Children muſt be Illegitimate, and Theſe alſo muſt be caſt off (as Baſe borne:) But it is not ſo; for, Your Children are Holy;</hi> that is, <hi>Legitimate.</hi>

                  <q>Secondly, although the child be not capable of the grace of the Sacrament by that way, whereby the growne are, by hearing, conceiving, and beleeving: yet this followes not, that Infants are not capable of Sacramentall grace in and by another way. Pittifull are the ſhifts of them that have no other way to ſtoppe an Anabaptiſts mouth, ſave by an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that an Infant may have faith. It's eaſie to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the gift conveyed, and the manner of conveying it. For if the former be, the latter in ſuch caſe will prove needleſſe.

Thus for error.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some <hi>faults in Diſcipline</hi> have been occaſioned by the way of baptiſme, among the Anabaptiſts.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That a particular Church is conſtituted by Baptiſme, and formally united, So Mr. <hi>K.</hi>

But if he means a member of any particular rightly conſtituted Church, according to the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of thoſe in the New Teſtament, and ancient antiquity, I altogether deny it for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Thoſe baptiſed <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. were in no particular Chriſtian Church, there being none gathered till a good while after that Chriſt had given the holy Supper to the Diſciples. 2 <hi>Cornelius</hi> his, and the <hi>Gaolers</hi> families, after the gathering of Churches, were not by that numbred to any particular Churches or <hi>thereby</hi> made particular Churches, that we read. Now that which exiſts afore or after a thing without that thing, cannot be the forme of that thing. 3 That which is common, cannot be proper and peculiar. But baptiſme is common to make men onely viſible Chriſtians in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:159553:111"/>generall. Therefore it is not proper and peculiar to make them of this or that particular Church. And therefore though godly men, or their infants have been baptized, yet the Churches think according to Scripture, that there muſt be ſomwhat more expreſſed to make ſuch to own this or that preaching officer to be their paſtor or teacher, <hi>whom they muſt obey in the Lord, and have in ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the works ſake.

               <p>Which we look upon us as a <hi>ſecond fault</hi> in diſcipline following upon the Anabaptiſts Baptiſme. For we find not that any baptized others, but either they were extraordinary Officer, as the Apoſtles, or Evangeliſts. Or elſe particular Churches Paſtours, or Teachers. Nor is there any thing in the Scriptures alleaged in their Confeſſion but to the ſame purpoſe we ſpeak. Divine reaſon alſo concurs with us. For a Diſciple, as a Diſciple, is only a member of the univerſall viſible Church. And ſo he can conferre nothing but what hee hath.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The form of Chriſts inſtitution, <hi>Mat</hi> 28.19, compared with the phraſe as it is uſed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. Or, <hi>were you baptized into the name of Paul?</hi> implies the ſame. On which place <hi>Beza,</hi>

                  <hi>The third reaſon is taken from the form and end of Baptiſme, in which we give our name to Chriſt, being called upon, with the Father and Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 That which is ſaid <hi>John</hi> 4, 2. <hi>He made and baptized more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Going, make Diſciples in all nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them;</hi> Intimate this. And if, as ſome affirme, Baptiſme was in uſe with the Jews, in the initiating of proſelytes into the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Judaiſme; this opinion is the more confirmed. But in Infant-Baptiſme the matter is ſo carried, that Baptiſm ſerves to confirm a benefit, not to ſignifie a profeſſion made: and ſo one, perhaps the chief end of Baptiſm is voyded. And here I think it is to be minded, that the uſuall deſcription of a Sacrament, and ſuch as are like to it, That it is a <hi>viſible ſigne of inviſible grace;</hi> hath occaſioned the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding of both Sacraments, as if they ſigned a divine benefit, not our duty, to which in the firſt place the Iuſtitution had reſpect.</p>
               <p>In ſeems to ſome, that Infant-baptiſm ſhould be good, becauſe the devil requires witches to renounce it: which reaſon, if ought worth, might as well prove Baptiſm of any Infants, Baptiſm by a midwife, good; becauſe theſe the devill requires them to renounce, as well that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:159553:120"/>which is of the Infants of believers, by a lawfull Miniſter. But the true reaſon why he requires the Baptiſme of witches to be renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them, is not becauſe the baptiſme is good in reſpect of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it; but becauſe the Faith mentioned in the form of baptiſme, is good; &amp; they that renounce not their baptiſme do ſhew their adherence to that faith in ſome ſort which cannot ſtand with an explicite Covenant with the Devill. Nor is the aſſuming of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in ripe years by thoſe who were waſhed in infancie a renounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of baptiſme, as ſome in their groſſe ignorance conceit; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a firmer avouching of baptiſme according to Chriſts minde.</p>
               <p>This more likely might be inferred from the Devils practice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring witches to renounce their baptiſme; That the profeſſion of Faith is the main buſineſſe in Baptiſme, which ſhould be before Baptiſme, if it were rightly adminiſtred after the firſt pattern.</p>
